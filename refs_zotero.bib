	abstract = {The effects of automotive-related lithium-ion module design, i.e. module stiffness and initial compression during module assembly on cell aging, swelling and pressure evolution are still largely unknown. This paper presents the results of a long-term aging study of 12 large-format automotive graphite/NMC 622 pouch cells, cycled for different module stiffnesses and initial compressions using design of experiments. Statistical analysis of mechanical and aging data revealed significant nonlinear (interaction) effects of both factors on pressure evolution, capacity loss and increase in internal resistance of the cells. Pressure dependent cell aging is observed over 1000 cycles, which was related to loss of active material at the cathode from differential voltage analysis. Post-mortem analysis confirmed a cathode active material loss via half- and full-cell measurements of harvested electrodes. Cross-section SEM micrographs revealed increasing NMC-particle cracking with higher pressure. Based on this, a fatigue-based aging model was developed to describe the capacity loss due to pressure dependent particle cracking. The presented approach enables both improved modeling of pressure dependent aging and lifetime optimized module design},

	abstract = {The Solid-Electrolyte-Interphase (SEI) model for non-aqueous alkali-metal batteries constitutes a paradigm change in the understanding of lithium batteries and has thus enabled the development of safer, durable, higher-power and lower-cost lithium batteries for portable and EV applications. Prior to the publication of the SEI model (1979), researchers used the Butler-Volmer equation, in which a direct electron transfer from the electrode to lithium cations in the solution is assumed. The SEI model proved that this is a mistaken concept and that, in practice, the transfer of electrons from the electrode to the solution in a lithium battery, must be prevented, since it will result in fast self-discharge of the active materials and poor battery performance. This model provides [E. Peled, in “Lithium Batteries,” J.P. Gabano (ed), Academic Press, (1983), E. Peled, J. Electrochem. Soc., 126, 2047 (1979).] new equations for: electrode kinetics (io and b), anode corrosion, SEI resistivity and growth rate and irreversible capacity loss of lithium-ion batteries. This model became a cornerstone in the science and technology of lithium batteries. This paper reviews the past, present and the future of SEI batteries.},

	abstract = {The lifetime of the battery significantly influences the acceptance of electric vehicles. Calendar aging contributes to the limited operating lifetime of lithium-ion batteries. Therefore, its consideration in addition to cyclical aging is essential to understand battery degradation. This study consequently examines the same graphite/NCA pouch cell that was the subject of previously published cyclic aging tests. The cells were aged at different temperatures and states of charge. The self-discharge was continuously monitored, and after each storage period, the remaining capacity and the impedance were measured. The focus of this publication is on the correlation of the measurements. An aging correlation is obtained that is valid for a wide range of temperatures and states of charge. The results show an accelerated capacity fade and impedance rise with increasing temperature, following the law of Arrhenius. However, the obtained data do also indicate that there is no path dependency, i.e., earlier periods at different temperature levels do not affect the present degradation rate. A large impact of the storage state of charge at 100\% is evident, whereas the influence is small below 80\%. Instead of the commonly applied square root of the time function, our results are in excellent agreement with an exponential function.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion battery formation affects battery cost, energy density, and lifetime. An improved understanding of the first cycle of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth on carbonaceous negative electrodes could aid in the design of optimized formation protocols. In this work, we systematically study SEI growth during the formation of carbon black negative electrodes in a standard carbonate electrolyte. We show that the initial ethylene carbonate (EC) reduction reaction occurs at ∼0.5–1.2 V during the first lithiation, except under fast lithiation rates (≥10C). The products of this EC reduction reaction do not passivate the electrode; only the SEI formed at lower potentials affects the second-cycle Coulombic efficiency. Thus, cycling quickly through the voltage regime of this reaction can decrease both formation time and first-cycle capacity loss, without an increase in subsequent-cycle capacity loss. We also show that the capacity consumed by this reaction is minimized at low temperatures and low salt concentrations. Finally, we discuss the mechanism behind our experimental results. This work reveals the fundamental processes underlying initial SEI growth on carbonaceous negative electrodes and provides insights for both optimizing the battery formation process and enabling novel electrolytes.},

              X-ray diffraction profilometry is used to characterize spatial distribution of the active materials, lithiation, and phase distribution in electrodes of NCM523/graphite coin cells. The X-ray data indicate uneven areal compression of the electrode assembly in such cells, which we trace to a specific design feature that leads to elastic deformation of a metal spacer. Steep lithiation gradients observed in the electrodes imply radially-dependent resistivity, for which uneven compression of the separator is a likely cause. Electrochemical model calculations suggest that variable porosity of the polymer separator would account for the salient features of spatial profiles observed in these coin cells.},

	abstract = {Lithium ion cells, when cycled, exhibit a two-stage degradation behavior characterized by a first linear stage and a second nonlinear stage where degradation is rapid. The multitude of degradation phenomena occurring in lithium ion batteries complicates the understanding of this two-stage degradation behavior. In this work, a simple and intuitive model is presented to analyze the coupled effect of resistance growth and the shape of the state of charge (SOC)-open circuit voltage (OCV) relationship in representing the complete degradation behavior. The model simulations demonstrate that a single resistance that increases linearly on cycling can capture the transition from slow to fast degradation, primarily due to the shape of the SOC-OCV curve. Further, the model simulations indicate that the shape of the degradation curve depends strongly on the magnitude of current at the end of discharge of the cycling protocol. To verify these observations, specific experiments are designed with minimal capacity loss but with shrinking operating voltage ranges that result in shrinking operating OCV range. The results of the experiments validate the observations of model simulations. Further, long-term cycling experiment with a commercial lithium ion cell shows that the operating OCV range shrinks substantially with aging and is a major reason for the observed accelerated degradation. The analysis of the present work provides significant insights towards developing simple semiempirical models suitable for battery life management in microcontrollers.},

We report on the relations between capacity’s knees, IR’s elbows and end of life for the large dataset of the study. We enhance our discussion with two applications. We use neural network techniques to build independent state of health capacity and IR predictor models achieving a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.4\% and 1.6\%, respectively, and an overall root mean squared error below 0.0061.

We also apply mathematical bounds on effective diffusivity to estimate porosity and tortuosity corrections.

Aging was observed as capacity fade and resistance increase, and the aging mechanisms were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and post-mortem analysis, where visual inspection and thickness measurements were employed together with X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analyses. It was observed that elevated temperatures resulted in accelerated capacity fade, especially for the +45 °C/+65 °C condition. SEI-layer growth and lithium plating, discovered in cell disassembly, were attributed to be the main mechanisms responsible for capacity loss. In addition to the capacity fade, resistance increase was observed both in ohmic and polarization resistances. The ohmic resistance growth was attributed to lack of electrolyte and increased separator resistance. Polarization resistance evolution during cycling was similar at room temperature and at +45 °C, but different at the +45 °C/+65 °C condition. It was concluded that post-mortem analysis is essential for attributing the cycle testing and impedance spectroscopy results to different components and processes inside the cell. For example, the lithium plating phenomenon could not have been predicted or discovered without disassembling the cells.},

	abstract = {Fast charging of lithium-ion batteries remains one of the most delicate challenges for the automotive industry, being seriously affected by the formation of lithium metal in the negative electrode. Here we present a physicochemical pseudo-3D model that explicitly includes the plating reaction as side reaction running in parallel to the main intercalation reaction. The thermodynamics of the plating reaction are modeled depending on temperature and ion concentration, which differs from the often-used assumption of a constant plating condition of 0 V anode potential. The reaction kinetics are described with an Arrhenius-type rate law parameterized from an extensive literature research. Re-intercalation of plated lithium was modeled to take place either via reverse plating (solution-mediated) or via an explicit interfacial reaction (surface-mediated). At low temperatures not only the main processes (intercalation and solid-state diffusion) become slow, but also the plating reaction itself becomes slower. Using this model, we are able to predict typical macroscopic experimental observables that are indicative of plating, that is, a voltage plateau during discharge and a voltage drop upon temperature increase. A spatiotemporal analysis of the internal cell states allows a quantitative insight into the competition between intercalation and plating. Finally, we calculate operation maps over a wide range of C-rates and temperatures that allow to assess plating propensity as function of operating condition.},

As the current density increases, the critical size that triggers non-uniform plating decreases, and we directly correlate size and current density to capacity fade of a battery. We also identify transitions from no plating, to heterogeneous plating, and to homogeneous plating. We show that diffusion plays a critical role in the aggregation of lithium, and the critical size is negatively correlated with current density and the effective diffusion length.

After the cycling, a macroscopic and microscopic optical analysis of the active and passive materials was executed. Also, scanning electron microscopy was used to analyze active material particles. The sphere shape results in a heterogenic pressure distribution on the lithium-ion battery and induces a ring of locally high electrochemical activity, which leads to lithium plating. Furthermore, a surface layer found on the anode, which is a possible cause of electrolyte degradation at the particle–electrolyte interface. Significant deformation and destruction of particles by the local pressure was observed on the cathode. The analysis results validate previous simulations and theories regarding lithium plating on edge effects.

Preventing metallic lithium from forming is difficult, as the heterogeneity of materials typically used in batteries can create transport non-uniformities, which can lead to unanticipated local plating. Therefore, being able to predict the occurrence of plating due to a non-uniformity of a certain shape and size becomes essential. In this study, we probe the importance of the size scale and geometry on localized plating through numerical simulations and experiments. Using modified separators to create transport non-uniformities, we show that certain geometric features lead to more vulnerability to plating, and localization strongly depends on size. A single large feature in a separator induces more plating than a collection of smaller features with same total area. Our findings help elucidate the fundamentals behind heterogeneous plating, which can provide practical insights into battery safety and product control.},

          , 
            Improvement of the performance of Li metal anodes is critical to enable high energy density rechargeable battery systems beyond Li-ion. However, a complete mechanistic understanding of electrode overpotential variations that occur during extended cycling of Li metal is lacking. Herein, we demonstrate that when using a Li metal electrode, the dynamic changes in voltage during extended cycles can be increasingly attributed to mass transport. It is shown that these mass transport effects arise as a result of dead Li accumulation at the Li metal electrode, which introduces a tortuous pathway for Li-ion transport. In Li–Li symmetric cells, mass transport effects cause the shape of the galvanostatic voltage response to change from “peaking” to “arcing”, along with an increase in total electrode overpotential. The continued accumulation of dead Li is also conclusively shown to directly cause capacity fade and rapid “failure” of Li–LCO full cells containing Li metal anodes. This work provides detailed insights into the coupled relationships between cycling, interphase morphology, mass transport and the overall cell performance. Furthermore, this work helps underscore the potential of Li–Li symmetric cells as a powerful analytical tool for understanding the effects of Li metal electrodes in full cell batteries.},

A mechanical model is proposed based on a system made of a spherical graphite particle surrounded by the solid electrolyte interphase layer. During lithium intercalation or de-intercalation, stresses in the graphite are produced, governed by the diffusion induced stress phenomena and in the solid electrolyte interphase, driven by the graphite expansion. The stresses in both materials were simulated and a sensitivity analysis was performed to clarify the inﬂuence of principal parameters on both processes. Finally, assuming that the solid electrolyte interphase is the weakest material and therefore more prone to fracture than graphite, the experimental capacity fade during cycling was modeled based on its break and repair effect rather than on the fracture of the active material. The mechanical model of the solid electrolyte interphase was implemented in a single particle lithium ion battery model in order to reproduce capacity fade during battery lifetime. The model results were compared against cycle life aging experimental data, reproducing accurately the inﬂuence of the depth of discharge as well as the average state of charge on the capacity fade.},

In this work, we investigate the full-cell evolution of lithium-ion batteries using two complementary techniques, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and ultrasonic time-of-ﬂight analysis, which make it possible to couple electrochemical and material property changes during cycling. It is found that there is a post-formation ‘‘break-in’’ period before full-cell behavior stabilizes. This period is signiﬁed by an increased swelling of the graphite anode, likely caused by side reactions, which increases the pressure within the cell. The increased pressure forces electrolyte to wet previously inactive portions of the lithium cobalt oxide cathode, lowering the cell impedance. The results demonstrate how the full-cell performance can be greatly affected by non-chemical crosstalk between the two electrodes and indicates the importance of using multiple complementary experimental techniques.},

	abstract = {In this contribution a simple in-situ method named capacity difference analysis (CDA) is introduced to characterize lateral flow of lithium-ions within the anode. Therefore, simply the difference between two capacity measurements, which are determined at significantly different current rates, are evaluated for each check-up. During aging the initial capacity difference of 2–3\% is reducing for all calendaric and cyclic aged cells until they reach a value which is close to zero difference. The initial capacity difference can be explained by lithium-ion flow between active and passive anode, whereby passive represents the excess anode without counter cathode (passive electrode effect). The successive reduction is likely caused by particle disconnection between active and passive anode and/or dry out of electrolyte in the anode overhang. Furthermore some cyclic aged cells reveal an increase after the initial decrease which can be associated to a process of forming a vertical deposition layer on top of the anode facing the separator that is not permeable to lithium-ions applying reasonable discharge currents. The CDA results are validated by laser microscope imaging after disassembling representative cells. The method is applied on a test matrix presented in our previous publication [1].},

	abstract = {Batteries are combinations of electrochemical cells that generate electricity to power electrical devices. Batteries are continuously converting chemical energy to electrical energy, and require appropriate maintenance to provide maximum efﬁciency. Management systems having specialized monitoring features; such as charge controlling mechanisms and temperature regulation are used to prevent health, safety, and property hazards that complement the use of batteries. These systems utilize measures of merit to regulate battery performances. Figures such as the state-of-health (SOH) and state-of-charge (SOC) are used to estimate the performance and state of the battery. In this paper, we propose an intelligent method to investigate the aforementioned parameters using a data-driven approach. We use a machine learning algorithm that extracts signiﬁcant features from the discharge curves to estimate these parameters. Extensive simulations have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed method under different currents and temperatures.},

The capacity losses were estimated after 300 cycles at 2C and 3C discharge rates and were found to be 13.2 and 16.9\% of the initial capacity, respectively. At 1C discharge rate the capacity lost was only 9.5\%. The cell cycled at high discharge rate (3C) showed the largest internal resistance increase of 27.7\% relative to the resistance of the fresh cells. The rate capability losses were proportional with the increase of discharge rates. Half-cell study and material and charge balances were used to quantify the capacity fade due to the losses of primary active material (Li+), the secondary active material (LiCoO2/C)) and rate capability losses. It was found that carbon with 10.6\% capacity loss after 300 cycles dominates the capacity fade of the whole cell at high discharge rates (3C). A mechanism is proposed which explains the capacity fade at high discharge rates.},

	abstract = {This paper represents the evaluation of ageing parameters in lithium iron phosphate based batteries, through investigating different current rates, working temperatures and depths of discharge. From these analyses, one can derive the impact of the working temperature on the battery performances over its lifetime. At elevated temperature (40°C), the performances are less compared to at 25°C. The obtained mathematical expression of the cycle life as function of the operating temperature reveals that the well-known Arrhenius law cannot be applied to derive the battery lifetime from one temperature to another. Moreover, a number of cycle life tests have been performed to illustrate the long-term capabilities of the proposed battery cells at different discharge constant current rates. The results reveal the harmful impact of high current rates on battery characteristics. On the other hand, the cycle life test at different depth of discharge levels indicates that the battery is able to perform 3221 cycles (till 80\% DoD) compared to 34,957 shallow cycles (till 20\% DoD). To investigate the cycle life capabilities of lithium iron phosphate based battery cells during fast charging, cycle life tests have been carried out at different constant charge current rates. The experimental analysis indicates that the cycle life of the battery degrades the more the charge current rate increases. From this analysis, one can conclude that the studied lithium iron based battery cells are not recommended to be charged at high current rates. This phenomenon affects the viability of ultra-fast charging systems. Finally, a cycle life model has been developed, which is able to predict the battery cycleability accurately.},

To ensure that subsequent production lots of batteries continue to meet the reliability requirements, ongoing reliability testing is often conducted on production lot samples. However, a key challenge is how to quickly determine if the samples have substantially similar reliability as those batteries that were initially qualiﬁed, and, in particular, how to detect early signs of unacceptable degradation. This paper uses ﬁve data-driven methods (regression model with prediction bound, one-class support vector machine, local outlier factor, Mahalanobis distance, and sequential probability ratio test) to detect anomalous degradation behavior of samples from actual production lots subjected to ongoing reliability tests. An ensemble approach was then developed because it was observed that no single method always gave the earliest warning.

Operando cell-stack pressure measurements performed on constrained pouch cells reveal a correlation between irreversible volume expansion and capacity loss caused by a continually thickening SEI. Several silicon-containing full-cell chemistries—LCO/graphite:Si-alloy, NCA/graphite:SiO, and NCA/Si:C—as well as a conventional NMC/graphite cell chemistry were investigated. The effect of FEC consumption on catastrophic failure was also investigated by comparing cells containing 10\% FEC and 1\% FEC. We show that once FEC is depleted, passivation failure occurs, resulting in massive, irreversible expansion indicating runaway SEI thickening and concomitant cell failure. This work demonstrates that irreversible volume expansion caused by SEI growth can be detected with operando pressure measurements, thus presenting a valuable tool for studying the degradation of Li-ion pouch cells and ranking the performance of different cell chemistries.},

Compared to traditional cycling, failure was reached up to 3.5 times faster. When this protocol was applied to cells containing low LiPF6 concentrations (≤ 0.4 M) failure was achieved up to 17.5 times faster than traditional cycling with normal LiPF6 concentrations. This represents a time improvement on the order of years and therefore can be used as a high-throughput screening method. Failure mechanisms for cells containing a range of LiPF6 concentrations undergoing these aggressive protocols were investigated using charge-discharge cycling, impedance spectroscopy (including symmetric cell analysis) and isothermal microcalorimetry. Long times at high voltage rapidly increase positive electrode impedance but do not seem to consume lithium inventory. The use of lower LiPF6 concentrations does not seem to introduce new failure mechanisms but makes cells less tolerant to positive electrode impedance growth. The utility of this method is demonstrated by screening cells with a variety of electrolyte additive combinations. Fewer than 3 months were required to distinguish cells containing 1\% lithium difluorophospate as superior to cells with other additive combinations.},

Moreover, a detailed assessment of charging strategies is performed, based on an extensive experimental study with three different cell types. The experimental results reveal that the impact of charging currents and charging voltages on cycle life can vary markedly among different lithium-ion batteries. In general, the cycle life is influenced more by high charging currents than by high discharging currents. Different boost charging protocols have disclosed that high charging currents can deteriorate cycle life not only at high state of charge (SoC), but also at very low SoC. Our investigations on pulse charging show that lithium-ion cells withstand charging pulses of high current or high voltage without any deterioration in cycle life, when the duration of the pulses remains short and the mean current and voltage values are considerably lower. For pulses of less than 1s, cycle life has been similar for pulsed and continuous charging with the same mean charging currents and identical cycle depths. This paper also presents the impact of charging currents and charging voltages on capacity utilization, charging time, and efficiency to support the development process of optimized charging protocols for practical applications.},

In this work several post-mortem analyses of cyclic aged cylindrical LFPjGraphite cells are evaluated to give a detailed characterization of the covering layer and to ﬁnd possible causes for the evolution of such a layer. The analyses of the layer with different methods return that it consists to high percentage of plated active lithium, deposited Fe and products of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The deposition is located mainly in the center of the cell symmetrical to the coating direction. The origin of these depositions is assumed in locally overcharged particles, Fe deposition or inhomogeneous distribution of capacity density. As a secondary effect the deposition on one side increases the thickness locally; thereafter a pressure-induced overcharging due to charge agglomeration of the back side of the anode occurs. Finally a compact and dense covering layer in a late state of aging leads to deactivation of the covered parts of the anode and cathode due to suppressed lithium-ion conductivity. This leads to increasing slope of capacity fade and increase of internal resistance.},

The test matrix includes a variation of possible influencing factors like current rates during cycling as well as tem- perature and state of charge during rest periods, rest period length and number of cycles between rest periods. A significant capacity recovery during rest periods is measured after cycling at moderate temperatures which
has only been reported for low temperature lithium plating experiments before. Rest periods were conducted at 100\% state of charge, thus the anode overhang effect can be excluded as the cause for the observed capacity increase. Voltage relaxation tests indicate that lithium plating occurs due to high current rates. Furthermore, a microscopic model is proposed to explain the long time constant of the limited exponential capacity increase during rest periods. Under these plating conditions a significant increase in cell cycle lifetime is observed if regular rest periods or standard characterizations are applied.},

The exact state of health of a battery is still a major challenge for analysis, especially since the individual ageing factors are not well understood and depend on the cell chemistry and design. In this analysis, X-ray computer tomographic (CT) images of new and aged battery electrodes are compared to determine structural changes over lifetime. The X-ray CT images with sub-micrometer resolution show the internal pore structure of the electrodes and allow the identification of the morphology of the materials. Organic residues and depositions responsible for reduced porosity in aged anodes are quantified and visualized. Furthermore, particle cracking and current collector corrosion is detected on the cathode side. All these are ageing effects, which might influence the cell capacity and impedance. A quantitative analysis of the lithium distribution completes the interpretation of the ageing study confirming that the degradation can be attributed to the loss of cyclable lithium which is bound in the particle surface layer of the anode.},

The model can simulate various “what-if” scenarios of battery degradation modes via a synthetic approach based on specific electrode behavior with proper adjustment of the loading ratio and the extent of degradation in and between the two electrodes. This approach is very different from the conventional empirical ones that correlate the cell parameters (such as impedance increases) with degradation in capacity or power fade to predict performance and life. This approach, with mechanistic understanding of battery degradation processes and failure mechanisms, offers unique high-fidelity simulation to address path dependence of the battery degradation.},

	abstract = {In this work, we present a novel approach to identify aging-minimal fast charging profiles for commercial lithium-ion cells by a design of experiment (DOE) methodology and a mechanistic degradation analysis of the obtained capacity retention figures. The DOE is based on the competitive comparison of specific current profiles under repeated application to the tested cell format. The current profiles are obtained from the linear superposition of a constant current profile and four independent, charge-neutral profiles modulating the shape of the base profile. The charge-neutral profiles rely on physically meaningful assumptions about their beneficial effects for the charging procedure, e.g. that a superimposed alternating current (AC) profile reduces unwanted polarization by its intrinsic heat generation. The aging minimal profiles are identified by multiple regression analysis. Mechanistic degradation analysis is applied to study the root cause of the observed capacity roll-over of the cells after a specific cycle number. This roll-over is attributed to the occurrence of lithium plating which itself is driven by active material losses in the initial stages of the cycle life. The onset of the roll-over can be considerably delayed by a suitable choice of the current trajectory, resulting in a more than doubled life expectancy.},

	abstract = {Lithium ion cells, when cycled, exhibit a two-stage degradation behavior characterized by a first linear stage and a second nonlinear stage where degradation is rapid. The multitude of degradation phenomena occurring in lithium ion batteries complicates the understanding of this two-stage degradation behavior. In this work, a simple and intuitive model is presented to analyze the coupled effect of resistance growth and the shape of the state of charge (SOC)-open circuit voltage (OCV) relationship in representing the complete degradation behavior. The model simulations demonstrate that a single resistance that increases linearly on cycling can capture the transition from slow to fast degradation, primarily due to the shape of the SOC-OCV curve. Further, the model simulations indicate that the shape of the degradation curve depends strongly on the magnitude of current at the end of discharge of the cycling protocol. To verify these observations, specific experiments are designed with minimal capacity loss but with shrinking operating voltage ranges that result in shrinking operating OCV range. The results of the experiments validate the observations of model simulations. Further, long-term cycling experiment with a commercial lithium ion cell shows that the operating OCV range shrinks substantially with aging and is a major reason for the observed accelerated degradation. The analysis of the present work provides significant insights towards developing simple semiempirical models suitable for battery life management in microcontrollers.},

Due to the low efficiency of the lithium plating/stripping process relative to the intercalation/deintercalation of lithium from graphite, small amounts of lithium plating can be detected through high accuracy measurements of coulombic efficiency. In this study, coulombic efficiency versus charging rate was measured at different temperatures and for two cell types. Small changes to the coulombic efficiency during cycling resulting from small amounts of lithium plating during the charging process were detected using a high precision charger. Cells were disassembled and examined to confirm the presence of lithium plating at the rates predicted to cause plating. This work shows how high precision coulometry can be used to maximize the performance of the cell through battery management by varying the maximum charge rate as a function of temperature to avoid lithium plating.},

The lifetime of these batteries will vary depending on their thermal environment and how they are charged and discharged. To optimal utilization of a battery over its lifetime requires characterization of its performance degradation under different storage and cycling conditions. Aging tests were conducted on commercial graphite/nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) Li-ion cells. A general lifetime prognostic model framework is applied to model changes in capacity and resistance as the battery degrades. Across 9 aging test conditions from 0oC to 55oC, the model predicts capacity fade with 1.4\% RMS error and resistance growth with 15\% RMS error. The model, recast in state variable form with 8 states representing separate fade mechanisms, is used to extrapolate lifetime for example applications of the energy storage system integrated with renewable photovoltaic (PV) power generation. Uncertainty quantification and further validation are needed.},

This reversible and SOC-depending capacity rise is explained by the passive electrode effect in this work. The theory assumes a slow, compensating ﬂow of active lithium between the passive and the active part of the anode, where the passive part represents the geometric excess anode with respect to the cathode. The theory is validated using a systematic test of 50 cylindrical 8 Ah LiFePO4jGraphite battery cells analyzed during cyclic and calendaric aging. The cyclic aging has been performed symmetrically at 40  C cell temperature, varying current rates and DODs. The calendar aging is executed at three temperatures and up to four SOCs. The aging is dominated by capacity fade while the increase of internal resistance is hardly inﬂuenced. Surprisingly shallow cycling between 45 and 55\% SOC shows stronger aging than aging at higher DOD and tests at 4 C exhibit less aging than aging at lower Crates. Aging mechanisms at 60  C seem to deviate from those at 40  C or lower.},

Then, two battery cells were aged at two diﬀerent cycle aging conditions until they lost 40\% and 60\% of their initial capacity, respectively. At that moment, the two battery cells were removed from the aging processes and were subjected to characterization measurements similar to the ones performed at BOL.

The effects of extended charge/discharge cycling on the morphology of the jelly roll of commercial 18650 lithium-ion battery cells (Sanyo UR18650E) are shown and discussed. Using micro X-ray computed tomography combined with post-mortem analysis it is shown that the jelly roll exhibits significant deformations after charge/discharge cycling. This effect appears despite the presence of a solid inner pin, which had been suggested in literature as prohibitive for jelly roll deformation. The effect is related to an inhomogeneous architecture of the cells caused mainly by the cathode tab in the vicinity of which deformations were observed most often. While it is shown here that such deformations eventually lead to delamination of the otherwise rather stable cathode coating and cause a rapid capacity fade, jelly roll deformation has also been observed after more than 1700 equivalent full cycles on cells which show a typical, non-accelerated ageing behavior for this cell type. A correlation between occurrence of delamination and occurrence of deformation was clearly identified by combining post-mortem and computed tomography analysis. It is discussed, if the well-documented deformation is caused by thickness variations of the anode and cathode during charge/discharge cycles. Furthermore, an in-depth characterization of the cell design is documented.},

	abstract = {For alternative vehicles, such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs), the high cost of lithium-ion battery packs is one of the major impediments to their market development. Due to the degradation of batteries in the vehicle, their life cycle comes to an end when the energy capacity is not sufﬁcient to fulﬁll the designed requirements for the vehicle. However, the capacity left in the batteries can still be reused for other energy storage applications that support the management of electrical system. The second use of electric vehicle batteries depends on precise forecast of State-of-Health (SOH) in the future. In this paper, a SOH prediction approach is proposed based on autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. At ﬁrst, through proper selection of model orders, a time series model is estimated based on the training data of previous SOH records. Next, the forecast is performed, and the prediction residue is analyzed to evaluate the obtained model by verifying whether the residue is white noise or not. A case study of battery aging test is conducted to validate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of the proposed approach.},

The tests comprise both calendar life tests at different ambient temperatures and constant cell voltages and cycle life tests operating the cells within several voltage ranges and levels using standard test proﬁles. In total, 73 cells have been tested. The calendar life test matrix especially investigates the inﬂuence of SOC on aging in detail, whereas the cycle life matrix focuses on a detailed analysis of the inﬂuence of cycle depth. The study shows signiﬁcant impact of the staging behavior of the carbon electrode on cycle life. Furthermore a strong inﬂuence of the carbon potential on calendar aging has been detected. Observed relations between aging and the different inﬂuence factors as well as possible degradation mechanisms are discussed. Analysis of C/4 discharge voltage curves suggests that cycle aging results in different aging processes and changes in material properties compared to calendar aging. Cycling, especially with cycles crossing transitions between voltage plateaus of the carbon electrode seems to destroy the carbon structure.},

	abstract = {Battery ageing is an important issue in e-mobility applications. The performance degradation of lithium-ion batteries has a strong influence on electric vehicles’ range and cost. Modelling capacity fade of lithium-ion batteries is not simple: many ageing mechanisms can exist and interact. Because calendar and cycling ageings are not additive, a major challenge is to model battery ageing in applications where the combination of cycling and rest periods are variable as, for example, in the electric vehicle application. In this work, an original approach to capacity fade modelling based on the formulation of reaction rate of a two-step reaction is proposed. A simple but effective model is obtained: based on only two differential equations and seven parameters, it can reproduce the capacity evolution of lithium-ion cells subjected to cycling profiles similar to those found in electric vehicle applications.},

	abstract = {High-performance batteries greatly benefit from accurate, early predictions of future capacity loss, to advance the management of the battery and sustain desirable application-specific performance characteristics for as long as possible. Li-ion cells exhibit a slow capacity degradation up to a knee-point, after which the degradation accelerates rapidly until the cell's End-of-Life. Using capacity degradation data, we propose a robust method to identify the knee-point within capacity fade curves. In a new approach to knee research, we propose the concept ‘knee-onset', marking the beginning of the nonlinear degradation, and provide a simple and robust identification mechanism for it. We link cycle life, knee-point and knee-onset, where predicting/identifying one promptly reveals the others. On data featuring continuous high C-rate cycling (1C–8C), we show that, on average, the knee-point occurs at 95\% capacity under these conditions and the knee-onset at 97.1\% capacity, with knee and its onset on average 108 cycles apart. After the critical identification step, we employ machine learning (ML) techniques for early prediction of the knee-point and knee-onset. Our models predict knee-point and knee-onset quantitatively with 9.4\% error using only information from the first 50 cycles of the cells' life. Our models use the knee-point predictions to classify the cells' expected cycle lives as short, medium or long with 88–90\% accuracy using only information from the first 3–5 cycles. Our accuracy levels are on par with existing literature for End-of-Life prediction (requiring information from 100-cycles), nonetheless, we address the more complex problem of knee prediction. All estimations are enriched with confidence/credibility metrics. The uncertainty regarding the ML model's estimations is quantified through prediction intervals. These yield risk-criteria insurers and manufacturers of energy storage applications can use for battery warranties. Our classification model provides a tool for cell manufacturers to speed up the validation of cell production techniques.},

Capacity curves cross each other often, a challenge for efforts to measure the state of health and predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of individual cells. We analyze capacity fade statistics for 24 commercial pouch cells, providing an estimate for the time to 5\% failure. Our data indicate that RUL predictions based on remaining capacity or internal resistance are accurate only once the cells have already sorted themselves into “better” and “worse” ones. Analysis of our failure data, using maximum likelihood techniques, provide uniformly good fits for a variety of definitions of failure with normal and with 2- and 3-parameter Weibull probability density functions, but we argue against using a 3-parameter Weibull function for our data. pdf fitting parameters appear to converge after about 15 failures, although business objectives should ultimately determine whether data from a given number of batteries provides sufficient confidence to end lifecycle testing. Increased efforts to make batteries with more consistent lifetimes should lead to improvements in battery cost and safety.},

The prediction requires a large amount of experimental data for various cycling environments to construct empirical equations or to obtain parameters in physical-based models. Based on the porous electrode theory, a semi-empirical model with three constant parameters is developed here. It is found that fading data at various temperatures collapse into a single curve on a newly proposed plot. This finding enables us to use a much smaller amount of cycle-life data to determine the values of these parameters, which sufficiently characterize the fading response under a broad range of cycling conditions. The prediction yielded from the model is confirmed by several scenarios with varying cycling conditions, such as temperature, depth of discharge, and C/D rate. A further prediction shows that different average C/D rates, which give rise to different cell-temperature histories, have a strong influence on the capacity degradation of an LIB. By introducing the average C/D rate, we analyze the capacity loss after 1500 cycles with the use of two types of charging protocols, from which two operational treatments are suggested.},

Plating induced LIB failure presents a major concern for emerging applications in transportation and electrical energy storage. Hence, the necessity to operando monitor, detect and analyze lithium plating becomes critical for safe and reliable usage of LIB systems. Here, we report in situ lithium plating analyses for a commercial graphite{\textbar}{\textbar}LiFePO4 cell cycled under dynamic stress test (DST) driving schedule. We designed a framework based on incremental capacity (IC) analysis and mechanistic model simulations to quantify degradation modes, relate their effects to lithium plating occurrence and assess cell degradation. The results show that lithium plating was induced by large loss of active material on the negative electrode that eventually led the electrode to over-lithiate. Moreover, when lithium plating emerged, we quantified that the loss of lithium inventory pace was increased by a factor of four. This study illustrates the benefits of the proposed framework to improve lithium plating analysis. It also discloses the symptoms of lithium plating formation, which prove valuable for novel, online strategies on early lithium plating detection.},

This study is focused on the nondestructive characterization of the aging behavior during long-term cycling at plating conditions, i.e. low temperature and high charge rate. A commercial graphite/LiFePO4 Li-ion battery is investigated in order to elucidate the aging effects of lithium plating for real-world purposes. It is shown that lithium plating can be observed as a loss of cyclable lithium which affects the capacity balance of the electrodes. In this way, lithium plating counteracts its own occurrence during prolonged cycling. The capacity losses due to lithium plating are therefore decreasing at higher cycle numbers and the capacity retention curve exhibits an inflection point. It is further shown that the observed capacity fade is partly reversible. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) reveals a significant increase of the ohmic cell resistance due to electrolyte consumption during surface film formation on the plated lithium. Additional cell opening provides important quantitative information regarding the thickness of the lithium layer and the corresponding mass of the plated lithium.},

Lithium deposition is connected not only to a drastic limitation of life-time, but also to fast-charging capability and safety issues. Lithium deposition in commercial Li-ion cells is not limited to operation conditions at low temperatures. In recent publications various types of commercial cells were investigated using complimentary analysis methods. Five cell types studied in literature (18650, 26650, pouch) serve as a basis for comparison when and why Li deposition happens in commercial Li-ion cells. In the present paper, we reviewed literature on (i) causes, (ii) hints and evidences for Li deposition, (iii) macroscopic morphology of Li deposition/plating, (iv) ageing mechanisms and shapes of capacity fade curves involving Li deposition, and (v) influences of Li deposition on safety. Although often discussed, safety issues regarding Li deposition are not only limited to dendrite growth and internal short circuits, but also to exothermic reactions in the presence of Lithium metal. Furthermore, we tried to connect knowledge from different length scales including the macroscopic level (Li-ion cells, operating conditions, gradients in cells, electrochemical tests, safety tests), the microscopic level (electrodes, particles, microstructure), and the atomic level (atoms, ions, molecules, energy barriers).},

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to show the buildup of SEI on the surface of the graphite anode, while nano-scale resolution X-ray computed tomography (nano-CT) was used to show the SEI accumulation within the anode's pore structure. Through a combination of phase contrast and absorption contrast imaging, it was shown that the average pore diameter and total internal pore volume fraction decreased significantly after cycling, while there was a corresponding increase of absorption contrast from heavier elements throughout the anode.

Postmortem analysis of the cells is performed after full-cell electrochemical characterization and discharge. EIS and capacity measurements are made on different parts of the disassembled cells. Material characterization includes SEM, EDX, HAXPES/XPS and XRD. The most remarkable result is that both cycled cells displayed highly uneven aging primarily of the graphite electrodes, showing large differences between the central parts of the jellyroll compared to the outer parts. The aging variations are identified as differences in capacity and impedance of the graphite electrode, associated with different SEI characteristics. Loss of cyclable lithium is mirrored by a varying degree of lithiation in the positive electrode and electrode slippage. The spatial variation in negative electrode degradation and utilization observed is most likely connected to gradients in temperature and pressure, that can give rise to current density and potential distributions within the jellyroll during cycling.},

An incremental capacity analysis was applied to identify various contributions to capacity loss, whereas the open circuit voltage measurements were utilized to trace the correct state of charge as the cell degrades in order to accurately correlate the capacity degradation with SOC. Our non-invasive, in situ analyses are in general consistent with current understanding of the degradation mechanism in this chemistry derived from post-mortem analysis.

	abstract = {The aging behavior of a commercial 2.3 Ah graphite/LFP cell during a year of cycling or storage at either 25 or 45°C is investigated. The performance decline of the cells during the aging period is monitored by non-destructive electrochemical techniques and is discussed in detail. An in-depth analysis of the aging results reveals that aging manifests itself more in terms of capacity loss rather than in terms of impedance increase, regardless of the cycling or storage conditions and of the temperature. The capacity fade is larger at 45°C than at 25°C, regardless of the cycling or storage conditions, and at a same temperature, cycling conditions are always more detrimental to capacity fade than storage conditions. The loss of cyclable lithium is identified as the main source of capacity fade in all cases, and for the cells aged at 45°C, a partial loss of graphite active material is suspected as well towards the end of the aging period.},

	abstract = {Reusing electric vehicle batteries once retired from the automotive application is stated as one of the possible solutions to reduce electric vehicle costs. Many publications in the literature have analyzed the economic viability of such a solution, and some car manufacturers have recently started running several projects to demonstrate the technical viability of the so-called battery second life. Nevertheless, the degradation behavior of second life batteries remains unknown and represents one of the biggest gaps in the literature. This paper aims at evaluating the effects of lithium-ion nickel manganese cobalt/carbon (NMC/C) battery state of health (SOH) and ageing history over the second life performance on two different applications, a residential demand management application and a power smoothing renewable integration application. The performance and degradation of second life batteries were assessed both at the cell level and at stack level. Homogeneous and heterogeneous stacks were analyzed in order to evaluate the impact of cell-to-cell history and SOH differences over the battery performance and degradation behavior. Results obtained showed a strong inﬂuence of the ﬁrst life battery ageing history upon the second life battery performance and degradation. Thereby, proper monitoring and battery selection appears crucial to certify the technical viability of battery second life.},

Aging phenomena were associated with the progressive decomposition of the electrolyte. Cell capacity loss was concluded to be dominated by SEI layer growth, which also led to a sharp power loss together with localized lithium plating on the negative electrode surface upon prolonged cycling. The graphite surface was polymerized and inactivated in localized central parts of the jelly-roll, leading to large cavities as a result of metallic lithium and electrolyte reactions. No degradation of the structure or performance of the LFP positive electrode was detected.

	abstract = {The potential reuse of lithium-ion batteries exhausted upon electric vehicle operation is a broadly discussed topic. However, a profound understanding of battery aging behavior is a prerequisite to assess overall system cost and economic beneﬁt of battery reuse: Whereas the capacity fade under load is commonly reported to show a linear dependency on charge throughput, a turning point to nonlinear aging characteristics is observed at residual capacities of about 80\% under different operational conditions. Based on a widespread aging matrix, results indicate an earlier appearance of nonlinear characteristics at high charging rates and operational voltage windows but low temperatures. Scanning electron microscopy images reveal areas of thick surface ﬁlms at the anode while the cathode stays unmodiﬁed. Therefore, a thickening of the solid electrolyte interphase, catalyzed by oxidation products migrating to the anode, is believed to be the dominating aging mechanism before the turning point. Afterwards, lithium plating might even occur at moderate temperatures and charging rates due to deteriorated ionic kinetics and graphite active material loss. As all these mechanisms are dependent on the cell potential, an optimized operational strategy may avoid or retard nonlinear aging characteristics and extend the life of lithium-ion cells.},

	abstract = {Some of the aging mechanisms occurring in Li ion batteries, either on rest or on cycling, are described from long-term storage or cycling data. Generally, the most critical part of the cell is the negative electrode/electrolyte interface. Stability of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI), more generally of the passivating layer, must be insured by proper material choice and additives. Excessive growth induces with time a capacity loss corresponding to the lithium corrosion, and a reduction of power capability of the electrode, from the active surface area degradation. In a worst case, reduction of charge rate capability may lead to local lithium plating during cycling, strongly aggravating the capacity fading. When the SEI is correctly built, with low electronic conductivity, the negative electrode stability can be very stable, as described by long-term aging (more than 4 years) at higher temperature than ambient. Vinylen carbonate is conﬁrmed as outstanding additive. At elevated temperature, high SOC induces side reactions at the positive interface, involving electrolyte components oxidation. The results are an increase of cell impedance, and possible slow CO2 evolution. Presence of lithium carbonate greatly enhanced the gas formation. The observed impedance increase indicates a reduction of the active surface area, in agreement with solid deposit. When properly designed with an appropriate choice of active materials and electrolyte, the Li ion system can provide a very long service.},

	abstract = {Second-life applications of automotive lithium-ion batteries are currently investigated for grid stabilization. Reutilization depends on reliable projections of the remaining useful life. However, reports on sudden degradation of lithium-ion-cells near 80\% state of health challenge these extrapolations. Sudden degradation was demonstrated for different positive active materials. This work elucidates the cause of sudden degradation in detail. As part of a larger study on nonlinear degradation, in-depth analyses of cells with different residual capacities are performed. Sudden degradation of capacity is found to be triggered by the appearance of lithium plating conﬁned to small characteristic areas, generated by heterogeneous compression. The resulting lithium loss rapidly alters the balancing of the electrodes, thus generating a self-amplifying circle of active material and lithium loss. Changes in impedance and open-circuit voltage are explained by the expansion of degraded patches. Destructive analysis reveals that sudden degradation is caused by the graphite electrode while the positive electrode is found unchanged except for delithiation caused by side reactions on the negative electrode. Our ﬁndings illustrate the importance of homogeneous compression of the electrode assembly and carbon electrode formulation. Finally, a quick test to evaluate the vulnerability of cell designs toward sudden degradation is proposed.},

	abstract = {The reutilization of batteries from electric vehicles allows to beneﬁt from their remaining energy capacity and to increase their lifespan. The applications considered for the second life of these batteries are less demanding than electric vehicles regarding power and energy density. However, there is still some uncertainty regarding the technical and economic viability of these systems. In this context, the study of the ageing and lifetime of reused batteries is key to contribute to their development. This paper assesses the experimental cycle ageing of lithiumion modules from diﬀerent Nissan Leaf through accelerated cycling tests on their second life. The evolution of the internal parameters during ageing and the correlation between them are shown, including the analysis of best ﬁtting curves. In addition, a second-life end-of-life criterion is proposed, based on capacity and internal resistance measurements during cells ageing, which can be applied to real application in order to prevent safety issues. By estimating future values from degradation trends and checking latter measurements, the ageing knee is identiﬁed. Results show that the modules operate for at least 2033 equivalent full cycles before reaching their ageing knee. This would mean more than 5 years of operation in a real second-life application, such as a photovoltaic self-consumption installation with daily cycling. Moreover, it is shown that a traditional cell characterisation based on capacity and internal resistance measurements is not enough to predict the durability of a cell during its second life.},

In this paper, we utilize a common pseudo two-dimensional (P2D) cell model to investigate the influence of different porosity profiles in the graphite electrode on the battery’s ageing. Ageing is modeled by two irreversible side reactions at the anode, the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and lithium plating. We use parameters of a high-energy cell with thick electrodes. A constant initial anode porosity as a reference is compared with two optimized porosity profiles. Simulation results show that by using a layered anode, a two-stage porosity profile with higher porosity at the separator side, the cycle count until sudden-death and especially the cycles for second-life applications can both almost be doubled.},

By an experiment with 48 cells from a mass production line it can be found that the aging spread cannot be neglected.

The measurable, physical effects of these degradation mechanisms on the cell can be summarised in terms of three degradation modes, namely loss of lithium inventory, loss of active positive electrode material and loss of active negative electrode material. The different degradation modes are assumed to have unique and measurable effects on the open circuit voltage (OCV) of Li-ion cells and electrodes. The presumptive nature and extent of these effects has so far been based on logical arguments rather than experimental proof. This work presents, for the first time, experimental evidence supporting the widely reported degradation modes by means of tests conducted on coin cells, engineered to include different, known amounts of lithium inventory and active electrode material. Moreover, the general theory behind the effects of degradation modes on the OCV of cells and electrodes is refined and a diagnostic algorithm is devised, which allows the identification and quantification of the nature and extent of each degradation mode in Li-ion cells at any point in their service lives, by fitting the cells' OCV.},

Stack stress is found to be a dynamic quantity, ﬂuctuating with charge/discharge and gradually increasing irreversibly over long times with cycling. Variations in initial stack pressure, an important controllable manufacturing parameter, are shown to produce different stress evolution characteristics over the lifetime of the cells. Cells manufactured with higher levels of stack pressure are found to exhibit shorter cycle lives, although small amounts of stack pressure lead to increased capacity retention over unconstrained cells. Postmortem analysis of these cells suggests a coupling between mechanics and electrochemistry in which higher levels of mechanical stress lead to higher rates of chemical degradation, while layer delamination is responsible for the capacity fade in unconstrained cells. Localized separator deformation resulting in nonuniform lithium transport is also observed in all cells.},

The cells were cycled at a rate of 1 C until the discharge capacity falls below 80\% of the initial capacity. Interestingly, an Arrhenius plot indicates two different ageing mechanisms for the ranges of −20 °C to 25 °C and 25 °C to 70 °C. Below 25 °C, the ageing rates increase with decreasing temperature, while above 25 °C ageing is accelerated with increasing temperature. The aged 18650 cells are inspected via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), inductively coupled plasma (ICP), measurements of electrode thickness and X-ray diffraction (XRD) after disassembly to learn more about the chemical reasons of the degradation. The effect of different temperatures on the electrode polarizations are evaluated by assembling electrodes in pouch cells with reference electrode as a model system.

	abstract = {The requirement for energy density of lithium-ion batteries becomes more urgent due to the rising demand for driving range of electric vehicles in recent years. Meanwhile, the performance stability of batteries with high energy densities tends to deteriorate, leading to accelerating degradation and safety issues. As a result, it is critical to explore the reasons that yield the sudden degradation and to recognize the degradation knee point of Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese batteries commonly used for electric vehicles. Existing results have disclosed that the lithium deposition of negative electrode dominates the sudden degradation of battery capacity. This paper extracts key parameters that characterize the aging status to facilitate knee point recognition in engineering practice. Furthermore, a novel method that integrates quantile regression and Monte Carlo simulation method to identify the accelerated fading knee point is introduced. The dynamic safety boundary determination method for the whole battery lifetime is proposed to update and monitor the safety zone. It is verified by experiments that the recognition results of capacity degradation knee point appear within 90–95\% capacity range at 25 °C, 35 °C and 45 °C conditions, which can provide an early warning before the battery fails. Using the proposed method for recognizing the sudden degradation of capacity, recognition result is effective even if the input is disturbed and has strong reliability and stability under different conditions. It is helpful to promote the sustainable and stable development of the electric vehicles and improve advanced applied energy technologies.},

Many models of degradation have been proposed in the literature, sometimes with a small experimental data set for validation. However, a comprehensive comparison between different model predictions is lacking, making it difficult to select modelling approaches which can explain the degradation trends actually observed from data. Here, various degradation models from literature are implemented within a single particle model framework and their behavior is compared. It is shown that many different models can be fitted to a small experimental data set. The interactions between different models are simulated, showing how some of the models accelerate degradation in other models, altering the overall degradation trend. The effects of operating conditions on the various degradation models is simulated. This identifies which models are enhanced by which operating conditions and might therefore explain specific degradation trends observed in data. Finally, it is shown how a combination of different models is needed to capture different degradation trends observed in a large experimental data set. Vice versa, only a large data set enables to properly select the models which best explain the observed degradation.},

In this work, we report a critical turning point during the aging of graphite/LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) full cells, after which the degradation is significantly accelerated. This turning point was identified using differential voltage analysis (DVA) applied to standard two-electrode data, which shows that graphite becomes progressively less lithiated, as confirmed by operando long-duration X-ray diffraction, and therefore has a higher electrochemical potential at the end of charge. This increase leads to a proportional increase in the cathode potential, and an accelerated impedance increase is observed from this point. This mechanism is expected to be universal for the vast majority of Li-ion battery chemistries, particularly for Ni-rich cathodes, whose degradation is extremely sensitive to the upper cutoff voltage, and our work provides fundamental guidelines for developing effective countermeasures.},

Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and Grid-to-vehicle (G2V) strategies are often cited as promising approaches to mitigate the intermittency of renewable energy on electric power grids. However, their impact on vehicle battery degradation have yet to be investigated in detail. Since battery degradation is path dependent, i.e. different usage schedules lead to different degradation mechanisms, it is essential to investigate batteries u nder realistic V2G and G2V scenarios. The aim of this work is to understand the effect of bidirectional charging on the degradation mechanisms of commercial Li-ion cells used in electric vehicles today. Results showed that an extra V2G step during cycle-aging accelerated capacity loss and degraded the kinetics at the negative electrode. Moreover, for all cycling duty cycles, the loss of active material at the negative electrode was higher than the loss of lithium inventory. This condition could trigger lithium plating and shorten cell lifetimes. In the calendar-aging experiments, state of charge was shown to be an important factor and interacted with temperature to accelerate the loss of active material at the positive electrode and the loss of lithium. It was also found that high state of charge values caused loss of active material at the negative electrode and kinetic limitations.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a testing method that allows the monitoring of the development of volume expansion of lithium-ion batteries. The overall goal is to demonstrate the impact of the volume expansion on battery ageing. The following findings are achieved: First, the characteristic curve shape of the diameter change depended on the state-of-charge and the load direction of the battery. The characteristic curve shape consisted of three areas. Second, the characteristic curve shape of the diameter change changed over ageing. Whereas the state-of-charge dependent geometric alterations were of a reversible nature. An irreversible effect over the lifetime of the cell was observed. Third, an s-shaped course of the diameter change indicated two different ageing effects that led to the diameter change variation. Both reversible and irreversible expansion increased with ageing. Fourth, a direct correlation between the diameter change and the capacity loss of this particular lithium-ion battery was observed. Fifth, computer tomography (CT) measurements showed deformation of the jelly roll and post-mortem analysis showed the formation of a covering layer and the increase in the thickness of the anode. Sixth, reproducibility and temperature stability of the strain gauges were shown. Overall, this paper provides the basis for a stable and reproducible method for volume expansion analysis applied and established by the investigation of a state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery cell. This enables the study of volume expansion and its impact on capacity and cell death.},

	abstract = {Forecasting the lifetime of Li-ion batteries is a critical challenge that limits the integration of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) into the automotive market. Cycle-life performance of Li-ion batteries is intrinsically linked to the fundamental understanding of ageing mechanisms. In contrast to most previous studies which utilise empirical trends (low real-time information) or rough simplifications on mathematical models to predict the lifetime of a Li-ion battery, we deployed a novel ageing formulation that includes heterogeneous dual-layer solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and lithium-plating ageing mechanisms with porosity evaluation. The proposed model is parameterized and optimized for mass transport and ageing parameters based on fresh and an aged cell and validated against our experimental results. We show that our advanced ageing mechanisms can accurately calculate experimentally observed cell voltage and capacity fade with respect to cycling number and can predict future fade for new operating scenarios based on constant-current and a dynamic power profile cycling exper­ imental data consisting of high discharge C-rates and fast-charging periods. Our model is able to capture the linear and nonlinear (knee-point) capacity fade characteristics with a high accuracy of 98\% goodness-of-fit-error and we compared our model performance with well-accepted existing model in literature.},

A full factorial design of experiment with three stress factors—ambient temperature (10 °C, 25 °C, 45 °C, 60 °C), discharge current rate (C-rate, 0.7C, 1C, 2C), and charge cut-off C-rate (C/5, C/40)—is used to study the effects of these stress factors on battery capacity fade and to obtain the data necessary for decision making. An empirical accelerated degradation model is then developed to capture the characteristics of the two-stage capacity degradation process, along with an accelerated test planning approach.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries typically exhibit a transition to a more rapid capacity fade trend when subjected to extended charge\&ndash;discharge cycles and storage conditions. The identification of the knee point can be valuable to identify the more severe degradation trend, and to provide guidance when scheduling battery replacements and planning secondary uses of the battery. However, a concise and repeatable determination of a knee point has not been documented. This paper provides a definition of the knee point which can be used as a degradation metric, and develops an algorithm to identify it. The algorithm is implemented on various data cases, and the results indicate that the approach provides repeatable knee point identification.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the origin of the jelly roll deformation in 18650 lithium-ion batteries is examined in more detail by combining volume expansion measurements, accelerated lifetime testing, and CT imaging. Based on the presented research, a theory is developed to determine the cause of the jelly roll deformation at low states of charge (0-20 \% SOC). The diameter of the cell is increasing during ageing, which reflects the increase of the internal pressure. Continuously growing cover layers of chemical degradation explain the latter. It is concluded that for releasing internal pressure, the jelly roll starts to deform. This deformation accelerates the ageing processes by electrically isolating active material from the current collector and the formation of fresh SEI. In addition, the CT images are used to determine the time of the deformation. Conclusively, it is shown that the jelly roll deformation is driven by cyclic ageing. Due to the correlation of the mean diameter change and the capacity curve, the deformation of the jelly roll and thus the sudden cell death can be predicted by measuring the mean diameter change of the battery.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are used as energy sources for energy storage systems, electric vehicles, consumer electronic devices and much more. Prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of such sources is vital to improve the safety and reliability of battery-powered systems. Even though several prognostic methods have been extensively explored for the RUL prediction of lithium-ion batteries, these methods are focused on adopting a single empirical / phenomenological degradation model which best describes the degradation behavior. However, certain lithium-ion battery materials exhibit two distinct degradation behaviors with an evident inﬂection point. In such cases, a single empirical model no longer holds good. Hence, we propose a piecewise degradation model along with a novel methodology to determine the inﬂection point. The proposed model is incorporated into a particle ﬁlter framework to predict the battery’s degradation trajectories. The effectiveness of the proposed model is veriﬁed by adding a 50dB noise to the measurement data. The prognostic results of the proposed piecewise model are compared with the existing single empirical model. We use prediction error and execution time as the prognostic metrics for comparison.},

	abstract = {A physics-based Li-ion battery (LIB) aging model accounting for both lithium plating and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth is presented, and is applied to study the aging behavior of a cell undergoing prolonged cycling at moderate operating conditions. Cell aging is found to be linear in the early stage of cycling but highly nonlinear in the end with rapid capacity drop and resistance rise. The linear aging stage is found to be dominated by SEI growth, while the transition from linear to nonlinear aging is attributed to the sharp rise of lithium plating rate. Lithium plating starts to occur in a narrow portion of the anode near the separator after a certain number of cycles. The onset of lithium plating is attributed to the drop of anode porosity associated with SEI growth, which aggravates the local electrolyte potential gradient in the anode. The presence of lithium metal accelerates the porosity reduction, further promoting lithium plating. This positive feedback leads to exponential increase of lithium plating rate in the late stage of cycling, as well as local pore clogging near the anode/separator interface which in turn leads to a sharp resistance rise.},

              Safe, fast, and energy efficient cycling of lithium ion batteries is desired in many practical applications. However, modeling studies predict steep Li

              ion gradients in the electrodes during cycling at the higher currents. Such gradients introduce heterogeneities in the electrodes, which make it difficult to predict cell lifetimes as different portions of the cell age at different rates. There is a dearth of experimental methods to probe these concentration gradients across the depth of the electrode. Here we use spatially resolved energy dispersive X-ray diffraction to obtain a “movie” of lithiation and delithiation in different sections of the cell and quantify lithium gradients that develop in a porous graphite electrode during cycling at a 1C rate. Inhomogeneity in the total Li content, and in the individual ordered Li

              ion gradients contribute to cell polarization, our results suggest that Li plating conditions can be met near the graphite electrode surface, even when the cell is charged at a moderate (1C) rate.},
