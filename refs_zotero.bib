	abstract = {Ageing of lithium-ion batteries results in irreversible reduction in performance. Intrinsic variability between cells, caused by manufacturing differences, occurs throughout life and increases with age. Researchers need to know the minimum number of cells they should test to give an accurate representation of population variability, since testing many cells is expensive. In this paper, empirical capacity versus time ageing models were fitted to various degradation datasets for commercially available cells assuming the model parameters could be drawn from a larger population distribution. Using a hierarchical Bayesian approach, we estimated the number of cells required to be tested. Depending on the complexity, ageing models with 1, 2 or 3 parameters respectively required data from at least 9, 11 or 13 cells for a consistent fit. This implies researchers will need to test at least these numbers of cells at each test point in their experiment to capture manufacturing variability.},

	title = {Accelerated battery lifetime simulations using adaptive inter-cycle extrapolation algorithm},
	abstract = {We propose algorithms to speed up physics-based battery lifetime simulations by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art. First, we propose a reformulation of the Single Particle Model with side reactions to remove algebraic equations and hence reduce stiﬀness, with 3x speed-up in simulation time (intra-cycle reformulation). Second, we introduce an algorithm that makes use of the diﬀerence between the ‘fast’ timescale of battery cycling and the ‘slow’ timescale of battery degradation by adaptively selecting and simulating representative cycles, skipping other cycles, and hence requires fewer cycle simulations to simulate the entire lifetime (adaptive inter-cycle extrapolation). This algorithm is demonstrated with a speciﬁc degradation mechanism but can be applied to various models of aging phenomena. In the particular case study considered, simulations of the entire lifetime are performed in under 5 seconds. This opens the possibility for much faster and more accurate model development, testing, and comparison with experimental data.},

Three types of 18650 lithium-ion cells, containing different cathode materials, have been examined. Our study demonstrates that calendar aging does not increase steadily with the SoC. Instead, plateau regions, covering SoC intervals of more than 20\%–30\% of the cell capacity, are observed wherein the capacity fade is similar. Differential voltage analyses confirm that the capacity fade is mainly caused by a shift in the electrode balancing. Furthermore, our study reveals the high impact of the graphite electrode on calendar aging. Lower anode potentials, which aggravate electrolyte reduction and thus promote solid electrolyte interphase growth, have been identified as the main driver of capacity fade during storage. In the high SoC regime where the graphite anode is lithiated more than 50\%, the low anode potential accelerates the loss of cyclable lithium, which in turn distorts the electrode balancing. Aging mechanisms induced by high cell potential, such as electrolyte oxidation or transition-metal dissolution, seem to play only a minor role. To maximize battery life, high storage SoCs corresponding to low anode potential should be avoided.},

	abstract = {Continuous operation of full cells with layered transition metal (TM) oxide positive electrodes (NCM523) leads to dissolution of TM ions and their migration and incorporation into the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) of the graphite-based negative electrode. These processes correlate with cell capacity fade and accelerate markedly as the upper cutoff voltage (UCV) exceeds 4.30 V. At voltages ≥4.4 V there is enhanced fracture of the oxide during cycling that creates new surfaces and causes increased solvent oxidation and TM dissolution. Despite this deterioration, cell capacity fade still mainly results from lithium loss in the negative electrode SEI. Among TMs, Mn content in the SEI shows a better correlation with cell capacity loss than Co and Ni contents. As Mn ions become incorporated into the SEI, the kinetics of lithium trapping change from power to linear at the higher UCVs, indicating a large effect of these ions on SEI growth and implicating (electro)catalytic reactions. We estimate that each MnII ion deposited in the SEI causes trapping of ∼102 additional Li+ ions thereby hastening the depletion of cyclable lithium ions. Using these results, we sketch a mechanism for cell capacity fade, emphasizing the conceptual picture over the chemical detail.},

The SEI layer resistance in the negative electrode of full cells increases with increasing concentration of transition metal salts. The growth of the SEI layer is non-uniform and is believed to be caused by the reduction of transition metal species in the negative electrode leading to an increase in inorganic component of the SEI layer.},

	abstract = {Large-format prismatic lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with 52 Ah capacity and Verband Der Automobilindustrie (VDA) standard dimensions were cycled under a preloading force of 2.5 kN at 25 °C. When cycled, the LIBs exhibited a two-stage degradation behavior characterized by a first linear degradation stage and a second nonlinear degradation stage. The two-stage behavior which is also called rollover failure is investigated by post-mortem analysis. When the jelly roll was unfolded, lithium plating and delamination of cathode materials were found in the curved areas. From the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, the graphite particles in the curved areas were deformed and cracked. The LIB under a higher preloading force of 5.5 kN was found to have shorter cycle life, indicating mechanical force is one of the factors that lead to the rollover failure. The degradation mechanism was thoroughly illustrated by applying shift voltage-resistance voltage (SV-RV), differential voltage (DV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The SV-RV analysis suggests that lithium plating occurs after around 300 cycles. The shifting to low capacity and broadening of peaks in dV/dQ curves indicate that the second nonlinear degradation stage could be caused by combining loss of active materials (LAM) and loss of lithium inventory (LLI). In the nonlinear degradation stage, ohmic resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) is dramatically increased as characterized by EIS measurement. The increased Rs and Rct further support the conclusion that LLI and LAM are the dominating degradation mechanism in the nonlinear degradation stage.},

In this paper, an electrochemical-thermal model is established to simulate temperature and discharging distribution in 3 × 3 square lithium-ion battery modules with both series and parallel connection. For series battery arrangement, the final voltage of each cell exhibits small difference after discharge. The final voltage of center battery shows the highest value, while that of battery at the corner shows the lowest values. As discharge rate increases, difference of final voltage between cells increases linearly. For parallel module, energy release is slightly higher than in series, but average temperature and maximum temperature difference are lower than in parallel. The diffusion polarization in electrolyte is found to be the most important factor for unbalanced discharging within modules. Furthermore, as the separation between cells increases in series module, final voltage of center battery gradually increases, and voltages of batteries on the corner continue to decrease. However, the rate of final voltage change of all cells rises more slowly. Moreover, the final temperature of parallel module is always lower than in series, and current difference between cells are almost same when separation between cells is greater than 1.5 mm.},

Particularly important for this purpose is the prediction of the internal temperature of cells, because of the positive feedback between heat generation and current distribution. In this work, a comprehensive electro-thermal model is developed for a cylindrical lithium-ion cell. The model is comprehensively parameterized and validated with experimental data for 2170 cylindrical cells (LG M50T, NMC811), including direct core temperature measurements. The validated model is used to study different cell designs and cooling approaches and their effects on the internal temperature of the cell. Increasing the number of tabs connecting the jellyroll to the base of the cylindrical-can reduces the internal thermal gradient by up to 25.41\%. On its own, side cooling is more effective than base cooling at removing heat, yet both result in thermal gradients within the cell of a similar magnitude, irrespective of the number of cell tabs. The results are of immediate interest to both cell manufacturers and battery pack designers, while the modelling and parameterization framework created is an essential tool for energy storage system design.},

	abstract = {Hundreds of millions of people lack access to electricity. Decentralised solar-battery systems are key for addressing this whilst avoiding carbon emissions and air pollution, but are hindered by relatively high costs and rural locations that inhibit timely preventative maintenance. Accurate diagnosis of battery health and prediction of end of life from operational data improves user experience and reduces costs. But lack of controlled validation tests and variable data quality mean existing lab-based techniques fail to work. We apply a scaleable probabilistic machine learning approach to diagnose health in 1027 solar-connected lead-acid batteries, each running for 400-760 days, totalling 620 million data rows. We demonstrate 73\% accurate prediction of end of life, eight weeks in advance, rising to 82\% at the point of failure. This work highlights the opportunity to estimate health from existing measurements using `big data' techniques, without additional equipment, extending lifetime and improving performance in real-world applications.},

	abstract = {Temperature has a significant influence on the behavior of batteries and their lifetime. There are several studies in literature that investigate the aging behavior under electrical load, but are limited to homogeneous, constant temperatures. This article presents an approach to quantifying cyclic aging of lithium-ion cells that takes into account complex thermal boundary conditions. It not only considers different temperature levels but also spatial and transient temperature gradients that can occur despite-or even due to-the use of thermal management systems. Capacity fade and impedance rise are used as measured quantities for degradation and correlated with the temperature boundary conditions during the aging process. The concept and definition of an equivalent aging temperature (EAT) is introduced to relate the degradation caused by spatial and temporal temperature inhomogeneities to similar degradation caused by a homogeneous steady temperature during electrical cycling. The results show an increased degradation at both lower and higher temperatures, which can be very well described by two superimposed exponential functions. These correlations also apply to cells that are cycled under the influence of spatial temperature gradients, both steady and transient. Only cells that are exposed to transient, but spatially homogeneous temperature conditions show a significantly different aging behavior. The concluding result is a correlation between temperature and aging rate, which is expressed as degradation per equivalent full cycle (EFC). This enables both temperature-dependent modeling of the aging behavior and its prediction.},

	abstract = {Mathematical models of capacity fade can reduce the time and cost of lithium-ion battery development and deployment, and growth of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is a major source of capacity fade. Experiments in Part I reveal nonlinear voltage dependence and strong charge-discharge asymmetry in SEI growth on carbon black negative electrodes, which is not captured by previous models. Here, we present a theoretical model for the electrochemical kinetics of SEI growth coupled to lithium intercalation, which accurately predicts experimental results with few adjustable parameters. The key hypothesis is that the initial SEI is a mixed ion-electron conductor, and its electronic conductivity varies approximately with the square of the local lithium concentration, consistent with hopping conduction of electrons along percolating networks. By including a lithium-ion concentration dependence for the electronic conductivity in the SEI, the bulk SEI thus modulates the overpotential and exchange current of the electrolyte reduction reaction. As a result, SEI growth is promoted during lithiation but suppressed during delithiation. This new insight establishes the fundamental electrochemistry of SEI growth kinetics. Our model improves upon existing models by introducing the effects of electrochemical SEI growth and its dependence on potential, current magnitude, and current direction in predicting capacity fade.},

Existing methods are based on relatively small but well-designed lab datasets and controlled test conditions but incorporating field data is crucial to build a complete picture of how cells age in real-world situations. This comes with additional challenges because end-use applications have uncontrolled operating conditions, less accurate sensors, data collection and storage concerns, and infrequent access to validation checks. We explore a range of techniques for estimating lifetime from lab and field data and suggest that combining machine learning approaches with physical models is a promising method, enabling inference of battery life from noisy data, assessment of second-life condition, and extrapolation to future usage conditions.

In Part I of this work, we present an electroanalytical method to measure the dependence of SEI growth on potential, current magnitude, and current direction during galvanostatic cycling of carbon black/Li half cells. We find that SEI growth strongly depends on all three parameters; most notably, we find SEI growth rates increase with nominal C rate and are significantly higher on lithiation than on delithiation. We observe this directional effect in both galvanostatic and potentiostatic experiments and discuss hypotheses that could explain this observation.

The parallel assembly reached end of life more rapidly for reasons unknown prior to CT investigations. The investigation revealed evidence of overdischarge in the most degraded cell from the parallel assembly, compared to more traditional failure in the individual cell. The parallel-wired cell exhibited dissolution of copper from the anode current collector and subsequent deposition throughout the separator near the cathode of the cell. This overdischarge-induced copper deposition, notably impossible to confirm with other state of health (SOH) monitoring methods, is diagnosed using CT by rendering the interior current collector without harm or alteration to the active materials. Correlation of CT observations to the electrochemical pulse data from the parallel-wired cells reveals the risk of parallel wiring during high C-rate pulse discharge.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms driving the thermo-electrochemical response of commercial lithium-ion cells under extreme overdischarge conditions ({\textless} 0.0 V) are investigated in the context of copper dissolution from the anodic current collector. A constant current discharge with no lower cutoff voltage was used to emulate the effects of forced overdischarge, as commonly experienced by serially connected cells in an unbalanced module. Cells were overdischarged to 200\% DOD (depth of discharge) at C/10 and 1C rates to develop an understanding of the overdischarge extremes. Copper dissolution began when a cell reached its minimum voltage level (between −1.3 V and −1.5 V), where the anode potential reached a maximum value of ∼4.8 V vs. Li/Li+. Deposition of copper on the cathode, anode, and separator surfaces was observed in all overdischarged cells, verified with EDS/SEM results, which further suggests the formation of internal shorts, although the cell failures proved to be relatively benign. The maximum cell surface temperature during overdischarge was found to be highly rate-dependent, with the 1C-rate cell experiencing temperatures as high as 79°C. Concentration polarization and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer breakdown prior to the initiation of copper dissolution are proposed to be the main sources of heat generation during overdischarge.},

Accurately forecasting their durability under different usage regimes has become a priority in determining the operational and commercial risks associated with BESS deployments. In this work, electrochemical data from a laboratory experiment mimicking different grid applications for two BESS deployed on the island of O'ahu and Moloka'i was analyzed. The results were extremely small capacity losses ({\textless}1\%) after more than a year of testing but significant amounts of underlying “silent” degradations with incubation periods. The impact of these silent degradations was quantified and used to forecast 20-year usage. They were shown to induce, in some cases, an acceleration of the capacity loss after as low as 6 years of deployment.},

Many publications in the literature have analyzed the economic viability of such a solution, and some car manufacturers have recently started running several projects to demonstrate the technical viability of the so-called battery second life. Nevertheless, the degradation behavior of second life batteries remains unknown and represents one of the biggest gaps in the literature. This paper aims at evaluating the effects of lithium-ion nickel manganese cobalt/carbon (NMC/C) battery state of health (SOH) and ageing history over the second life performance on two different applications, a residential demand management application and a power smoothing renewable integration application. The performance and degradation of second life batteries were assessed both at the cell level and at stack level. Homogeneous and heterogeneous stacks were analyzed in order to evaluate the impact of cell-to-cell history and SOH differences over the battery performance and degradation behavior. Results obtained showed a strong inﬂuence of the ﬁrst life battery ageing history upon the second life battery performance and degradation. Thereby, proper monitoring and battery selection appears crucial to certify the technical viability of battery second life.},

Aging phenomena were associated with the progressive decomposition of the electrolyte. Cell capacity loss was concluded to be dominated by SEI layer growth, which also led to a sharp power loss together with localized lithium plating on the negative electrode surface upon prolonged cycling. The graphite surface was polymerized and inactivated in localized central parts of the jelly-roll, leading to large cavities as a result of metallic lithium and electrolyte reactions. No degradation of the structure or performance of the LFP positive electrode was detected.

	abstract = {The potential reuse of lithium-ion batteries exhausted upon electric vehicle operation is a broadly discussed topic. However, a profound understanding of battery aging behavior is a prerequisite to assess overall system cost and economic beneﬁt of battery reuse: Whereas the capacity fade under load is commonly reported to show a linear dependency on charge throughput, a turning point to nonlinear aging characteristics is observed at residual capacities of about 80\% under different operational conditions. Based on a widespread aging matrix, results indicate an earlier appearance of nonlinear characteristics at high charging rates and operational voltage windows but low temperatures. Scanning electron microscopy images reveal areas of thick surface ﬁlms at the anode while the cathode stays unmodiﬁed. Therefore, a thickening of the solid electrolyte interphase, catalyzed by oxidation products migrating to the anode, is believed to be the dominating aging mechanism before the turning point. Afterwards, lithium plating might even occur at moderate temperatures and charging rates due to deteriorated ionic kinetics and graphite active material loss. As all these mechanisms are dependent on the cell potential, an optimized operational strategy may avoid or retard nonlinear aging characteristics and extend the life of lithium-ion cells.},

	abstract = {Second-life applications of automotive lithium-ion batteries are currently investigated for grid stabilization. Reutilization depends on reliable projections of the remaining useful life. However, reports on sudden degradation of lithium-ion-cells near 80\% state of health challenge these extrapolations. Sudden degradation was demonstrated for different positive active materials. This work elucidates the cause of sudden degradation in detail. As part of a larger study on nonlinear degradation, in-depth analyses of cells with different residual capacities are performed. Sudden degradation of capacity is found to be triggered by the appearance of lithium plating conﬁned to small characteristic areas, generated by heterogeneous compression. The resulting lithium loss rapidly alters the balancing of the electrodes, thus generating a self-amplifying circle of active material and lithium loss. Changes in impedance and open-circuit voltage are explained by the expansion of degraded patches. Destructive analysis reveals that sudden degradation is caused by the graphite electrode while the positive electrode is found unchanged except for delithiation caused by side reactions on the negative electrode. Our ﬁndings illustrate the importance of homogeneous compression of the electrode assembly and carbon electrode formulation. Finally, a quick test to evaluate the vulnerability of cell designs toward sudden degradation is proposed.},

	abstract = {Some of the aging mechanisms occurring in Li ion batteries, either on rest or on cycling, are described from long-term storage or cycling data. Generally, the most critical part of the cell is the negative electrode/electrolyte interface. Stability of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI), more generally of the passivating layer, must be insured by proper material choice and additives. Excessive growth induces with time a capacity loss corresponding to the lithium corrosion, and a reduction of power capability of the electrode, from the active surface area degradation. In a worst case, reduction of charge rate capability may lead to local lithium plating during cycling, strongly aggravating the capacity fading. When the SEI is correctly built, with low electronic conductivity, the negative electrode stability can be very stable, as described by long-term aging (more than 4 years) at higher temperature than ambient. Vinylen carbonate is conﬁrmed as outstanding additive. At elevated temperature, high SOC induces side reactions at the positive interface, involving electrolyte components oxidation. The results are an increase of cell impedance, and possible slow CO2 evolution. Presence of lithium carbonate greatly enhanced the gas formation. The observed impedance increase indicates a reduction of the active surface area, in agreement with solid deposit. When properly designed with an appropriate choice of active materials and electrolyte, the Li ion system can provide a very long service.},

	abstract = {The reutilization of batteries from electric vehicles allows to beneﬁt from their remaining energy capacity and to increase their lifespan. The applications considered for the second life of these batteries are less demanding than electric vehicles regarding power and energy density. However, there is still some uncertainty regarding the technical and economic viability of these systems. In this context, the study of the ageing and lifetime of reused batteries is key to contribute to their development. This paper assesses the experimental cycle ageing of lithiumion modules from diﬀerent Nissan Leaf through accelerated cycling tests on their second life. The evolution of the internal parameters during ageing and the correlation between them are shown, including the analysis of best ﬁtting curves. In addition, a second-life end-of-life criterion is proposed, based on capacity and internal resistance measurements during cells ageing, which can be applied to real application in order to prevent safety issues. By estimating future values from degradation trends and checking latter measurements, the ageing knee is identiﬁed. Results show that the modules operate for at least 2033 equivalent full cycles before reaching their ageing knee. This would mean more than 5 years of operation in a real second-life application, such as a photovoltaic self-consumption installation with daily cycling. Moreover, it is shown that a traditional cell characterisation based on capacity and internal resistance measurements is not enough to predict the durability of a cell during its second life.},

Ageing is modeled by two irreversible side reactions at the anode, the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and lithium plating. We use parameters of a high-energy cell with thick electrodes. A constant initial anode porosity as a reference is compared with two optimized porosity profiles. Simulation results show that by using a layered anode, a two-stage porosity profile with higher porosity at the separator side, the cycle count until sudden-death and especially the cycles for second-life applications can both almost be doubled.},

The measurable, physical effects of these degradation mechanisms on the cell can be summarised in terms of three degradation modes, namely loss of lithium inventory, loss of active positive electrode material and loss of active negative electrode material. The different degradation modes are assumed to have unique and measurable effects on the open circuit voltage (OCV) of Li-ion cells and electrodes. The presumptive nature and extent of these effects has so far been based on logical arguments rather than experimental proof. This work presents, for the first time, experimental evidence supporting the widely reported degradation modes by means of tests conducted on coin cells, engineered to include different, known amounts of lithium inventory and active electrode material. Moreover, the general theory behind the effects of degradation modes on the OCV of cells and electrodes is refined and a diagnostic algorithm is devised, which allows the identification and quantification of the nature and extent of each degradation mode in Li-ion cells at any point in their service lives, by fitting the cells' OCV.},

Stack stress is found to be a dynamic quantity, ﬂuctuating with charge/discharge and gradually increasing irreversibly over long times with cycling. Variations in initial stack pressure, an important controllable manufacturing parameter, are shown to produce different stress evolution characteristics over the lifetime of the cells. Cells manufactured with higher levels of stack pressure are found to exhibit shorter cycle lives, although small amounts of stack pressure lead to increased capacity retention over unconstrained cells. Postmortem analysis of these cells suggests a coupling between mechanics and electrochemistry in which higher levels of mechanical stress lead to higher rates of chemical degradation, while layer delamination is responsible for the capacity fade in unconstrained cells. Localized separator deformation resulting in nonuniform lithium transport is also observed in all cells.},

	abstract = {The effects of temperatures in the range of −20 °C to 70 °C on the ageing behaviour of cycled Lithium-ion batteries are investigated quantitatively by electrochemical methods and Post-Mortem analysis. Commercial 18650-type high-power cells with a LixNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2/LiyMn2O4 blend cathode and graphite/carbon anode were used as test system. The cells were cycled at a rate of 1 C until the discharge capacity falls below 80\% of the initial capacity. Interestingly, an Arrhenius plot indicates two different ageing mechanisms for the ranges of −20 °C to 25 °C and 25 °C to 70 °C. Below 25 °C, the ageing rates increase with decreasing temperature, while above 25 °C ageing is accelerated with increasing temperature. The aged 18650 cells are inspected via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), inductively coupled plasma (ICP), measurements of electrode thickness and X-ray diffraction (XRD) after disassembly to learn more about the chemical reasons of the degradation. The effect of different temperatures on the electrode polarizations are evaluated by assembling electrodes in pouch cells with reference electrode as a model system. We find that the dominating ageing mechanism for T {\textless} 25 °C is Lithium plating, while for T {\textgreater} 25 °C the cathodes show degeneration and the anodes will be increasingly covered by SEI layers.},

Many models of degradation have been proposed in the literature, sometimes with a small experimental data set for validation. However, a comprehensive comparison between different model predictions is lacking, making it difficult to select modelling approaches which can explain the degradation trends actually observed from data. Here, various degradation models from literature are implemented within a single particle model framework and their behavior is compared. It is shown that many different models can be fitted to a small experimental data set. The interactions between different models are simulated, showing how some of the models accelerate degradation in other models, altering the overall degradation trend. The effects of operating conditions on the various degradation models is simulated. This identifies which models are enhanced by which operating conditions and might therefore explain specific degradation trends observed in data. Finally, it is shown how a combination of different models is needed to capture different degradation trends observed in a large experimental data set. Vice versa, only a large data set enables to properly select the models which best explain the observed degradation.},

Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and Grid-to-vehicle (G2V) strategies are often cited as promising approaches to mitigate the intermittency of renewable energy on electric power grids. However, their impact on vehicle battery degradation have yet to be investigated in detail. Since battery degradation is path dependent, i.e. different usage schedules lead to different degradation mechanisms, it is essential to investigate batteries u nder realistic V2G and G2V scenarios. The aim of this work is to understand the effect of bidirectional charging on the degradation mechanisms of commercial Li-ion cells used in electric vehicles today. Results showed that an extra V2G step during cycle-aging accelerated capacity loss and degraded the kinetics at the negative electrode. Moreover, for all cycling duty cycles, the loss of active material at the negative electrode was higher than the loss of lithium inventory. This condition could trigger lithium plating and shorten cell lifetimes. In the calendar-aging experiments, state of charge was shown to be an important factor and interacted with temperature to accelerate the loss of active material at the positive electrode and the loss of lithium. It was also found that high state of charge values caused loss of active material at the negative electrode and kinetic limitations.},

Prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of such sources is vital to improve the safety and reliability of battery-powered systems. Even though several prognostic methods have been extensively explored for the RUL prediction of lithium-ion batteries, these methods are focused on adopting a single empirical / phenomenological degradation model which best describes the degradation behavior. However, certain lithium-ion battery materials exhibit two distinct degradation behaviors with an evident inﬂection point. In such cases, a single empirical model no longer holds good. Hence, we propose a piecewise degradation model along with a novel methodology to determine the inﬂection point. The proposed model is incorporated into a particle ﬁlter framework to predict the battery’s degradation trajectories. The effectiveness of the proposed model is veriﬁed by adding a 50dB noise to the measurement data. The prognostic results of the proposed piecewise model are compared with the existing single empirical model. We use prediction error and execution time as the prognostic metrics for comparison.},

	abstract = {The contribution introduces a new theory explaining the capacity increase that is often observed in early stages of life of lithium-ion batteries. This reversible and SOC-depending capacity rise is explained by the passive electrode effect in this work. The theory assumes a slow, compensating ﬂow of active lithium between the passive and the active part of the anode, where the passive part represents the geometric excess anode with respect to the cathode. The theory is validated using a systematic test of 50 cylindrical 8 Ah LiFePO4jGraphite battery cells analyzed during cyclic and calendaric aging. The cyclic aging has been performed symmetrically at 40  C cell temperature, varying current rates and DODs. The calendar aging is executed at three temperatures and up to four SOCs. The aging is dominated by capacity fade while the increase of internal resistance is hardly inﬂuenced. Surprisingly shallow cycling between 45 and 55\% SOC shows stronger aging than aging at higher DOD and tests at 4 C exhibit less aging than aging at lower Crates. Aging mechanisms at 60  C seem to deviate from those at 40  C or lower.},

Then, two battery cells were aged at two diﬀerent cycle aging conditions until they lost 40\% and 60\% of their initial capacity, respectively. At that moment, the two battery cells were removed from the aging processes and were subjected to characterization measurements similar to the ones performed at BOL.

The effects of extended charge/discharge cycling on the morphology of the jelly roll of commercial 18650 lithium-ion battery cells (Sanyo UR18650E) are shown and discussed. Using micro X-ray computed tomography combined with post-mortem analysis it is shown that the jelly roll exhibits significant deformations after charge/discharge cycling. This effect appears despite the presence of a solid inner pin, which had been suggested in literature as prohibitive for jelly roll deformation. The effect is related to an inhomogeneous architecture of the cells caused mainly by the cathode tab in the vicinity of which deformations were observed most often. While it is shown here that such deformations eventually lead to delamination of the otherwise rather stable cathode coating and cause a rapid capacity fade, jelly roll deformation has also been observed after more than 1700 equivalent full cycles on cells which show a typical, non-accelerated ageing behavior for this cell type. A correlation between occurrence of delamination and occurrence of deformation was clearly identified by combining post-mortem and computed tomography analysis. It is discussed, if the well-documented deformation is caused by thickness variations of the anode and cathode during charge/discharge cycles. Furthermore, an in-depth characterization of the cell design is documented.},

	abstract = {An extensive set of accelerated aging tests has been carried out employing a Li-ion high energy 18650 system (2.05 Ah), negative electrode: carbon, positive electrode: Li(NiMnCo)O2). It is manufactured by Sanyo, labeled UR18650E, and is a commercial off-the-shelf product. The tests comprise both calendar life tests at different ambient temperatures and constant cell voltages and cycle life tests operating the cells within several voltage ranges and levels using standard test proﬁles. In total, 73 cells have been tested. The calendar life test matrix especially investigates the inﬂuence of SOC on aging in detail, whereas the cycle life matrix focuses on a detailed analysis of the inﬂuence of cycle depth. The study shows signiﬁcant impact of the staging behavior of the carbon electrode on cycle life. Furthermore a strong inﬂuence of the carbon potential on calendar aging has been detected. Observed relations between aging and the different inﬂuence factors as well as possible degradation mechanisms are discussed. Analysis of C/4 discharge voltage curves suggests that cycle aging results in different aging processes and changes in material properties compared to calendar aging. Cycling, especially with cycles crossing transitions between voltage plateaus of the carbon electrode seems to destroy the carbon structure.},

	abstract = {Battery ageing is an important issue in e-mobility applications. The performance degradation of lithium-ion batteries has a strong influence on electric vehicles’ range and cost. Modelling capacity fade of lithium-ion batteries is not simple: many ageing mechanisms can exist and interact. Because calendar and cycling ageings are not additive, a major challenge is to model battery ageing in applications where the combination of cycling and rest periods are variable as, for example, in the electric vehicle application. In this work, an original approach to capacity fade modelling based on the formulation of reaction rate of a two-step reaction is proposed. A simple but effective model is obtained: based on only two differential equations and seven parameters, it can reproduce the capacity evolution of lithium-ion cells subjected to cycling profiles similar to those found in electric vehicle applications.},

	abstract = {High-performance batteries greatly benefit from accurate, early predictions of future capacity loss, to advance the management of the battery and sustain desirable application-specific performance characteristics for as long as possible. Li-ion cells exhibit a slow capacity degradation up to a knee-point, after which the degradation accelerates rapidly until the cell's End-of-Life. Using capacity degradation data, we propose a robust method to identify the knee-point within capacity fade curves. In a new approach to knee research, we propose the concept ‘knee-onset', marking the beginning of the nonlinear degradation, and provide a simple and robust identification mechanism for it. We link cycle life, knee-point and knee-onset, where predicting/identifying one promptly reveals the others. On data featuring continuous high C-rate cycling (1C–8C), we show that, on average, the knee-point occurs at 95\% capacity under these conditions and the knee-onset at 97.1\% capacity, with knee and its onset on average 108 cycles apart. After the critical identification step, we employ machine learning (ML) techniques for early prediction of the knee-point and knee-onset. Our models predict knee-point and knee-onset quantitatively with 9.4\% error using only information from the first 50 cycles of the cells' life. Our models use the knee-point predictions to classify the cells' expected cycle lives as short, medium or long with 88–90\% accuracy using only information from the first 3–5 cycles. Our accuracy levels are on par with existing literature for End-of-Life prediction (requiring information from 100-cycles), nonetheless, we address the more complex problem of knee prediction. All estimations are enriched with confidence/credibility metrics. The uncertainty regarding the ML model's estimations is quantified through prediction intervals. These yield risk-criteria insurers and manufacturers of energy storage applications can use for battery warranties. Our classification model provides a tool for cell manufacturers to speed up the validation of cell production techniques.},

Capacity curves cross each other often, a challenge for efforts to measure the state of health and predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of individual cells. We analyze capacity fade statistics for 24 commercial pouch cells, providing an estimate for the time to 5\% failure. Our data indicate that RUL predictions based on remaining capacity or internal resistance are accurate only once the cells have already sorted themselves into “better” and “worse” ones. Analysis of our failure data, using maximum likelihood techniques, provide uniformly good fits for a variety of definitions of failure with normal and with 2- and 3-parameter Weibull probability density functions, but we argue against using a 3-parameter Weibull function for our data. pdf fitting parameters appear to converge after about 15 failures, although business objectives should ultimately determine whether data from a given number of batteries provides sufficient confidence to end lifecycle testing. Increased efforts to make batteries with more consistent lifetimes should lead to improvements in battery cost and safety.},

The prediction requires a large amount of experimental data for various cycling environments to construct empirical equations or to obtain parameters in physical-based models. Based on the porous electrode theory, a semi-empirical model with three constant parameters is developed here. It is found that fading data at various temperatures collapse into a single curve on a newly proposed plot. This finding enables us to use a much smaller amount of cycle-life data to determine the values of these parameters, which sufficiently characterize the fading response under a broad range of cycling conditions. The prediction yielded from the model is confirmed by several scenarios with varying cycling conditions, such as temperature, depth of discharge, and C/D rate. A further prediction shows that different average C/D rates, which give rise to different cell-temperature histories, have a strong influence on the capacity degradation of an LIB. By introducing the average C/D rate, we analyze the capacity loss after 1500 cycles with the use of two types of charging protocols, from which two operational treatments are suggested.},

Plating induced LIB failure presents a major concern for emerging applications in transportation and electrical energy storage. Hence, the necessity to operando monitor, detect and analyze lithium plating becomes critical for safe and reliable usage of LIB systems. Here, we report in situ lithium plating analyses for a commercial graphite{\textbar}{\textbar}LiFePO4 cell cycled under dynamic stress test (DST) driving schedule. We designed a framework based on incremental capacity (IC) analysis and mechanistic model simulations to quantify degradation modes, relate their effects to lithium plating occurrence and assess cell degradation. The results show that lithium plating was induced by large loss of active material on the negative electrode that eventually led the electrode to over-lithiate. Moreover, when lithium plating emerged, we quantified that the loss of lithium inventory pace was increased by a factor of four. This study illustrates the benefits of the proposed framework to improve lithium plating analysis. It also discloses the symptoms of lithium plating formation, which prove valuable for novel, online strategies on early lithium plating detection.},

This study is focused on the nondestructive characterization of the aging behavior during long-term cycling at plating conditions, i.e. low temperature and high charge rate. A commercial graphite/LiFePO4 Li-ion battery is investigated in order to elucidate the aging effects of lithium plating for real-world purposes. It is shown that lithium plating can be observed as a loss of cyclable lithium which affects the capacity balance of the electrodes. In this way, lithium plating counteracts its own occurrence during prolonged cycling. The capacity losses due to lithium plating are therefore decreasing at higher cycle numbers and the capacity retention curve exhibits an inflection point. It is further shown that the observed capacity fade is partly reversible. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) reveals a significant increase of the ohmic cell resistance due to electrolyte consumption during surface film formation on the plated lithium. Additional cell opening provides important quantitative information regarding the thickness of the lithium layer and the corresponding mass of the plated lithium.},

Lithium deposition is connected not only to a drastic limitation of life-time, but also to fast-charging capability and safety issues. Lithium deposition in commercial Li-ion cells is not limited to operation conditions at low temperatures. In recent publications various types of commercial cells were investigated using complimentary analysis methods. Five cell types studied in literature (18650, 26650, pouch) serve as a basis for comparison when and why Li deposition happens in commercial Li-ion cells. In the present paper, we reviewed literature on (i) causes, (ii) hints and evidences for Li deposition, (iii) macroscopic morphology of Li deposition/plating, (iv) ageing mechanisms and shapes of capacity fade curves involving Li deposition, and (v) influences of Li deposition on safety. Although often discussed, safety issues regarding Li deposition are not only limited to dendrite growth and internal short circuits, but also to exothermic reactions in the presence of Lithium metal. Furthermore, we tried to connect knowledge from different length scales including the macroscopic level (Li-ion cells, operating conditions, gradients in cells, electrochemical tests, safety tests), the microscopic level (electrodes, particles, microstructure), and the atomic level (atoms, ions, molecules, energy barriers).},

Through a combination of phase contrast and absorption contrast imaging, it was shown that the average pore diameter and total internal pore volume fraction decreased significantly after cycling, while there was a corresponding increase of absorption contrast from heavier elements throughout the anode.

The most remarkable result is that both cycled cells displayed highly uneven aging primarily of the graphite electrodes, showing large differences between the central parts of the jellyroll compared to the outer parts. The aging variations are identified as differences in capacity and impedance of the graphite electrode, associated with different SEI characteristics. Loss of cyclable lithium is mirrored by a varying degree of lithiation in the positive electrode and electrode slippage. The spatial variation in negative electrode degradation and utilization observed is most likely connected to gradients in temperature and pressure, that can give rise to current density and potential distributions within the jellyroll during cycling.},

An in-depth analysis of the aging results reveals that aging manifests itself more in terms of capacity loss rather than in terms of impedance increase, regardless of the cycling or storage conditions and of the temperature. The capacity fade is larger at 45°C than at 25°C, regardless of the cycling or storage conditions, and at a same temperature, cycling conditions are always more detrimental to capacity fade than storage conditions.

	abstract = {The requirement for energy density of lithium-ion batteries becomes more urgent due to the rising demand for driving range of electric vehicles in recent years. Meanwhile, the performance stability of batteries with high energy densities tends to deteriorate, leading to accelerating degradation and safety issues. As a result, it is critical to explore the reasons that yield the sudden degradation and to recognize the degradation knee point of Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese batteries commonly used for electric vehicles. Existing results have disclosed that the lithium deposition of negative electrode dominates the sudden degradation of battery capacity. This paper extracts key parameters that characterize the aging status to facilitate knee point recognition in engineering practice. Furthermore, a novel method that integrates quantile regression and Monte Carlo simulation method to identify the accelerated fading knee point is introduced. The dynamic safety boundary determination method for the whole battery lifetime is proposed to update and monitor the safety zone. It is verified by experiments that the recognition results of capacity degradation knee point appear within 90–95\% capacity range at 25 °C, 35 °C and 45 °C conditions, which can provide an early warning before the battery fails. Using the proposed method for recognizing the sudden degradation of capacity, recognition result is effective even if the input is disturbed and has strong reliability and stability under different conditions. It is helpful to promote the sustainable and stable development of the electric vehicles and improve advanced applied energy technologies.},

	abstract = {Summary Li-ion batteries based on Ni-rich layered cathodes are the state-of-the-art technology for electric vehicles; however, batteries using these advanced materials suffer from rapid performance fading. In this work, we report a critical turning point during the aging of graphite/LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) full cells, after which the degradation is significantly accelerated. This turning point was identified using differential voltage analysis (DVA) applied to standard two-electrode data, which shows that graphite becomes progressively less lithiated, as confirmed by operando long-duration X-ray diffraction, and therefore has a higher electrochemical potential at the end of charge. This increase leads to a proportional increase in the cathode potential, and an accelerated impedance increase is observed from this point. This mechanism is expected to be universal for the vast majority of Li-ion battery chemistries, particularly for Ni-rich cathodes, whose degradation is extremely sensitive to the upper cutoff voltage, and our work provides fundamental guidelines for developing effective countermeasures.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a testing method that allows the monitoring of the development of volume expansion of lithium-ion batteries. The overall goal is to demonstrate the impact of the volume expansion on battery ageing. The following findings are achieved: First, the characteristic curve shape of the diameter change depended on the state-of-charge and the load direction of the battery. The characteristic curve shape consisted of three areas. Second, the characteristic curve shape of the diameter change changed over ageing. Whereas the state-of-charge dependent geometric alterations were of a reversible nature. An irreversible effect over the lifetime of the cell was observed. Third, an s-shaped course of the diameter change indicated two different ageing effects that led to the diameter change variation. Both reversible and irreversible expansion increased with ageing. Fourth, a direct correlation between the diameter change and the capacity loss of this particular lithium-ion battery was observed. Fifth, computer tomography (CT) measurements showed deformation of the jelly roll and post-mortem analysis showed the formation of a covering layer and the increase in the thickness of the anode. Sixth, reproducibility and temperature stability of the strain gauges were shown. Overall, this paper provides the basis for a stable and reproducible method for volume expansion analysis applied and established by the investigation of a state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery cell. This enables the study of volume expansion and its impact on capacity and cell death.},

	abstract = {Forecasting the lifetime of Li-ion batteries is a critical challenge that limits the integration of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) into the automotive market. Cycle-life performance of Li-ion batteries is intrinsically linked to the fundamental understanding of ageing mechanisms. In contrast to most previous studies which utilise empirical trends (low real-time information) or rough simplifications on mathematical models to predict the lifetime of a Li-ion battery, we deployed a novel ageing formulation that includes heterogeneous dual-layer solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and lithium-plating ageing mechanisms with porosity evaluation. The proposed model is parameterized and optimized for mass transport and ageing parameters based on fresh and an aged cell and validated against our experimental results. We show that our advanced ageing mechanisms can accurately calculate experimentally observed cell voltage and capacity fade with respect to cycling number and can predict future fade for new operating scenarios based on constant-current and a dynamic power profile cycling exper­ imental data consisting of high discharge C-rates and fast-charging periods. Our model is able to capture the linear and nonlinear (knee-point) capacity fade characteristics with a high accuracy of 98\% goodness-of-fit-error and we compared our model performance with well-accepted existing model in literature.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the origin of the jelly roll deformation in 18650 lithium-ion batteries is examined in more detail by combining volume expansion measurements, accelerated lifetime testing, and CT imaging. Based on the presented research, a theory is developed to determine the cause of the jelly roll deformation at low states of charge (0-20 \% SOC). The diameter of the cell is increasing during ageing, which reflects the increase of the internal pressure. Continuously growing cover layers of chemical degradation explain the latter. It is concluded that for releasing internal pressure, the jelly roll starts to deform. This deformation accelerates the ageing processes by electrically isolating active material from the current collector and the formation of fresh SEI. In addition, the CT images are used to determine the time of the deformation. Conclusively, it is shown that the jelly roll deformation is driven by cyclic ageing. Due to the correlation of the mean diameter change and the capacity curve, the deformation of the jelly roll and thus the sudden cell death can be predicted by measuring the mean diameter change of the battery.},

The lifetime of these batteries will vary depending on their thermal environment and how they are charged and discharged. To optimal utilization of a battery over its lifetime requires characterization of its performance degradation under different storage and cycling conditions. Aging tests were conducted on commercial graphite/nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) Li-ion cells. A general lifetime prognostic model framework is applied to model changes in capacity and resistance as the battery degrades. Across 9 aging test conditions from 0°C to 55°C, the model predicts capacity fade with 1.4\% RMS error and resistance growth with 15\% RMS error. The model, recast in state variable form with 8 states representing separate fade mechanisms, is used to extrapolate lifetime for example applications of the energy storage system integrated with renewable photovoltaic (PV) power generation. Uncertainty quantification and further validation are needed.},

The irreversible capacity losses under various cycling conditions and temperatures are accurately obtained from the extrapolated EMF curves and are found to increase with cycle number and time. A new mathematical extrapolation method is proposed to distinguish between calendar ageing and cycling-induced ageing. The capacity losses due to calendar aging are obtained by extrapolating the total irreversible capacity losses to zero cycle number. It is found that calendar ageing increases logarithmically in time. On the other hand, cycling-induced ageing is accurately determined by extrapolating the capacity losses to zero time. In this case the capacity losses are found to increase linearly with cycle number. It is furthermore found that iron dissolution from the cathode at 60  C and the subsequent deposition onto the anode enhances signiﬁcantly the SEI formation on the graphite electrode and, consequently, battery ageing. Interestingly, the graphite electrode decay has been quantiﬁed in much more detail, by analyzing the dVEMF =dQ curves. The analyses show that the electrode decay can be related to both the structural deterioration and the inter-layer surface blockage of the graphite electrode, as has also been experimentally conﬁrmed by Raman and XPS spectroscopy.},

This work is a post-mortem study of 18650-type cells subjected to charge rates of 0.7-, 2-, 4-, and 6-C. For cells charged at 0.7-C to 4-C, this performance degradation is primarily related to surface film thickness with no observable change in surface film chemical composition. However, at charge rates of 6-C, the chemical composition of the surface film changes significantly, suggesting that this change is the reason for the sharper increase in cell resistance compared to the lower charge rates. In addition, we found that surface film formation was not uniform across the electrode. Surface film was thicker and chemically different along the central band of the electrode “jelly roll”. This result is most likely attributable to an increase in temperature that results from non-uniform electrode wetting during manufacture. This non-uniform change further resulted in active material delamination from the current collector owing to chemical changes to the binder for the cell charged at 6-C.},

While the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase and the subsequent loss of cyclable lithium have been well studied, mechanical degradation remains an area where ambiguity remains. While there appears to be little experimental evidence that suggest that macroscopic particle cracking occurs, mathematical models have suggested that this phenomenon is likely. The goal of this paper is to clarify this ambiguity by combining experimental cycling, mathematical stress modeling, and post-mortem microscopy. We experimentally determine an average diffusion coefficient of lithium in graphite using a thin-layer electrode and use this information in a diffusion-induced stress model. Our results suggest that cracking is not likely during lithiation due to the proximity of equilibrium potential to the cutoff potential. On delithiation, at 25°C, even at 30 C rate cracking is unlikely while at −10°C, a rate of 10 C can lead to particle cracking. By extrapolating the results of the thin-layer electrode to a thick porous electrode, we found that graphite cracking is unlikely to occur during typical vehicle operations.},

	abstract = {Thick Li-ion battery electrodes with high ion transport rates could enable batteries that cost less and that have higher gravimetric and volumetric energy density, because they require fewer inactive cell-components. Finding ways to increase ion transport rates in thick electrodes would be especially valuable for electrodes made with graphite platelets, which have been shown to have tortuosities in the thru-plane direction about 3 times higher than in the in-plane direction. Here, we predict that bi-tortuous electrode structures (containing electrolyte-filled macro-pores embedded in micro-porous graphite) can enhance ion transport and can achieve double the discharge capacity compared to an unstructured electrode at the same average porosity. We introduce a new two-dimensional version of porous-electrode theory with anisotropic ion transport to investigate these effects and to interpret the mechanisms by which performance enhancements arise. From this analysis we determine criteria for the design of bi-tortuous graphite anodes, including the particular volume fraction of macro-pores that maximizes discharge capacity (approximately 20 vol.\%) and a threshold spacing interval (half the electrode's thickness) below which only marginal enhancement in discharge capacity is obtained. We also report the sensitivity of performance with respect to cycling rate, electrode thickness, and average porosity/electroactive-material loading.},

	abstract = {A critical aging mechanism in lithium-ion batteries is the decomposition of the electrolyte at the negative electrode forming a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer that increases impedance and consumes cyclable lithium. In contrast to the typical nanometer SEI layer generally discussed, this paper reports on the formation of a micrometer thick film on top of and within the upper part of a porous graphite electrode in a deep-cycled commercial cylindrical LiFePO4/graphite cell. Morphological, chemical, and electrochemical characterizations were performed by means of cross-sectional electron microscopy in combination with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and focused ion-beam milling, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to evaluate the properties and impact of the uneven film. It is shown that the film is enriched in P–O and carbonate species but is otherwise similar in composition to the thin SEI formed on a calendar-aged electrode and clogs the pores in the electrode closest to the separator. Performance evaluation by physics-based EIS modeling supports a local porosity decrease, impeding the effective electrolyte transport in the electrode. The local variation of electrode properties implies that current distribution in the porous electrode under these cycling conditions causes inefficient material utilization and sustained uneven electrode degradation.},

Enhanced electrochemical performance was observed for SiNW anodes in alkyl carbonates electrolyte solutions containing fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). Reduced irreversible capacity losses accompanied by enhanced and stable reversible capacities over prolonged cycling were achieved with FEC-containing electrolyte solutions. TEM studies provided evidence for the complete and incomplete lithiation of SiNW's in FEC-containing and FEC-free electrolyte solutions, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results proved the formation of much thinner and compact surface films on SiNW's in FEC-containing solutions. However, thicker surface films were identified for SiNW electrodes cycled in FEC-free solutions. SiNW electrodes develop lower impedance in electrolyte solutions containing FEC in contrast to standard (FEC-free) solutions. The surface chemistry of SiNW electrodes cycled in FEC-modified and standard electrolytes were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The impact of FEC as a co-solvent on the electrochemical behavior of SiNW electrodes is discussed herein in light of the spectroscopic and microscopic studies.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the test results and life modeling of special calendar- and cycle-life tests conducted on 18650-size generation 1 (Gen 1) lithium-ion battery cells (nominal capacity of 0.9Ah; 3.0–4.1V rating) developed to establish a baseline chemistry and performance for the Department of Energy sponsored advanced technology development (ATD) program. Electrical performance testing was conducted at the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Sandia National Laboratory (SNL) and the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). As part of the electrical performance testing, a new calendar-life test protocol was used. The test consisted of a once per day discharge and charge pulse designed to have minimal impact on the cell yet establish its performance over a period of time such that the calendar-life of the cell could be determined. The calendar-life test matrix included two states-of-charge (SOCs) (i.e. 60 and 80\%) and four test temperatures (40, 50, 60 and 70°C). Discharge and regen resistances were calculated from the test data. Results indicate that both the discharge and regen resistances increased non-linearly as a function of the test time. The magnitude of the resistances depended on the temperature and SOC at which the test was conducted. Both resistances had a non-linear increase with respect to time at test temperature. The discharge resistances are greater than the regen resistances at all of the test temperatures of 40, 50, 60 and 70°C. For both the discharge and regen resistances, generally the higher the test temperature, the lower the resistance. The measured resistances were then used to develop an empirical model that was used to predict the calendar-life of the cells. This model accounted for the time, temperature and SOC of the batteries during the calendar-life test. The functional form of the model is given by: R(t,T,SOC)=A(T, SOC)F(t)+B(T, SOC), where t is the time at test temperature, T the test temperature and SOC the SOC of the cell at the start of the test. A(T, SOC) and B(T, SOC) are assumed to be functions of the temperature and SOC; F is assumed to only be a function of the time at test temperature. Using curve-fitting techniques for a number of time-dependent functions, it was found that both the discharge and regen resistances were best correlated with F(t) having a square-root of test time dependence. These results led to the relationship for the discharge and regen resistances: R(t,T,SOC)=A(T, SOC)t1/2+B(T, SOC). The square-root of time dependence can be accounted for by either a one-dimensional diffusion type of mechanism, presumably of the lithium-ions or by a parabolic growth mechanism for the growth of a thin-film solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer on the anode and/or cathode. The temperature dependence of the resistance was then investigated using various model fits to the functions A(T, SOC) and B(T, SOC). The results of this exercise lead to a functional form for the temperature dependence of the fitting functions having an Arrhenius-like form: A(T,SOC)=a(SOC)\{exp[b(SOC)/T]\} and B(T,SOC)=c(SOC)\{exp[d(SOC)/T]\}, where a and c are constants, and b and d are related to activation energy (Eb and Ed) by using the gas constant (R) such that b=Eb/R and d=Ed/R. The functional form, therefore, for the discharge and regen resistances, including the SOC, is then: R(t,T,SOC)=a(SOC)\{exp[b(SOC)/T]\}t1/2+c(SOC)\{exp[d(SOC)/T]\}. The a, b, c and d parameters are explicitly shown as being functions of the SOC. However, due to the lack of testing at SOC values other than 60 and 80\% SOC, the exact form of the SOC dependence could not be determined from the experimental data. The values of a, b, c and d were determined, thus permitting the function R(t, T, SOC) to be used to correlate the discharge and regen data and to predict what the resistances would be at different test times and temperatures. This paper also presents, discusses and models the results of a special cycle-life test conducted for a period of time at specified temperatures of 40, 50, 60 and 70°C. This test, consisting of specified discharge and charge protocols, was designed to establish the cycle-life performance of the cells over a time interval such that their cycle-life could be determined. The cycle-life test was conducted at 60\% SOC, with SOC swings of Δ3, Δ6 and Δ9\%. During the cycle-life test, the discharge and regen resistances were determined after every 100 test cycles. The results of the cycle-life testing indicate that both the discharge and regen resistances increased non-linearly as a function of the test time at each Δ\% SOC test. The magnitude of the resistances and the rate at which they changed depended on the temperature and Δ\% SOC at which the test was conducted. Both resistances had a non-linear increase with respect to time at test temperature, i.e. as the number of test cycles increased the discharge and regen resistances increased also. For a given Δ\% SOC test, the discharge resistances are greater than the regen resistances at all of the test temperatures of 40, 50, 60 and 70°C. For both the discharge and regen resistances, generally the higher the test temperature, the lower the resistance. At each of the four test temperatures, the magnitude of the discharge and regen resistances was generally in the following order: Δ3\% SOC{\textgreater}Δ9\% SOC{\textgreater}Δ6\% SOC, but the ordering was dependent on test time. A model was also developed to account for the time, temperature, SOC and Δ\% SOC of the batteries during the cycle-life test. The functional form of the model is given by R(t,T,SOC,Δ\%SOC)=A(T, SOC, Δ\% SOC)F(t)+B(T, SOC, Δ\% SOC) where t is the time at test temperature, T the test temperature, SOC the SOC of the cell at the start and end of the test and Δ\% SOC the SOC swing during the test. A(T, SOC, Δ\% SOC) and B(T, SOC, Δ\% SOC) are assumed to be functions of the test temperature, SOC and Δ\% SOC swing. F(t) is assumed to only be a function of the test time at test temperature. Using curve-fitting techniques for a number of time-dependent functions, it was found that both the discharge and regen resistances were best correlated by a square-root of test time dependence. These results led to the relationship for the discharge and regen resistances having the form R(t,T,SOC,Δ\%SOC)=A(T, SOC, Δ\% SOC)t1/2+B(T, SOC, Δ\% SOC). This model is essentially the same as used to analyze the calendar-life test data. The temperature dependence of the resistance was then investigated using various model fits to the functions A(T) and B(T). The results of this exercise lead to a functional form for the functions having again an Arrhenius-like form: A(T)=a[exp(b/T)] and B(T)=c[exp(d/T)] where a and c are constants, and b and d are related to activation energies. The functional form, therefore, for the discharge and regen resistances including the SOC and Δ\% SOC is R(t,T,SOC,Δ\%SOC)=a(SOC, Δ\% SOC)\{exp[b(SOC, Δ\% SOC)/T]\}t1/2+c(SOC, Δ\% SOC)\{exp[d(SOC, Δ\% SOC)/T]\}. The a, b, c and d parameters are explicitly shown as being functions of the SOC and the Δ\% SOC. However, due to the lack of testing at SOC values other than 60\% SOC, the exact form of the SOC dependence could not be determined from the experimental data. In addition, no model was found that consistently correlated the observed resistance changes with the Δ\% SOC of the tests. Eliminating the SOC and Δ\% SOC from the resistance function, the function R(t, T) was then used to correlate the discharge and regen resistances data. This model also allows the prediction of what the resistances would be at different test times at a particular Δ\% SOC test condition and temperature.},

	abstract = {As a consequence of the remarkable increase in the production of electric cars, the cost per kWh of battery packs is more decreasing, although it still has a considerable impact on the purchase price of these vehicles.This paper describes the optimal cost analysis of battery packs for different electric cars among full battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). In fact, the cost optimization of battery use also depends on the type of electric vehicle and not only on battery pack type, operating conditions and driver's style. Thus, the proposed analysis aims to optimize battery costs over time by considering battery life degradation for various types of electric cars. The results indicate a greater degradation of a PHEV battery, for urban trips with many stops, with respect to a BEV battery, with the consequence of an expected early replacement of the PHEV battery before the warranty expires. In this context, the usage rate of a BEV battery is about 50\% of that of a PHEV battery.},

In calendar life experiments, useful cell life was strongly affected by temperature and time. Temperature accelerated cell performance degradation. The rates of area specific impedance (ASI) increase and power fade followed simple laws based on a power of time and Arrhenius kinetics. The data have been modeled using these two concepts and the calculated data agree well with the experimental values. The calendar life ASI increase and power fade data follow (time)1/2 kinetics. This behavior may be due to solid electrolyte interface layer growth. From the cycle life experiments, the ASI increase data follow (time)1/2 kinetics also, but there is an apparent change in overall power fade mechanism when going from 3 to 6\% ΔSOC. Here, the power of time drops to below 1/2, which indicates that the power fade mechanism is more complex than layer growth.},

The experiments show that time and temperature, not cycle count, are the dominant contributors to the growth of the SEI. The charge consumed by the SEI and hence the SEI thickness, increase approximately with time1/2 consistent with a process where the temperature-dependent SEI growth rate is inversely proportional to the SEI thickness. The charge consumed by the SEI is proportional to the electrode surface area and this increased consumption on high surface area electrodes continues during cycling, at least with the 1 M LiPF6 ethylene carbonate:diethyl carbonate electrolyte used.},

Synthetic driving cycles have been essential in accumulating data on EV battery lifetimes. However, since battery deterioration is path-dependent, the representability of synthetic cycles must be questioned. Hence, this work compared three different synthetic driving cycles to real driving data in terms of mimicking actual EV battery degradation. It was found that the average current and charge capacity during discharge were important parameters in determining the appropriate synthetic profile, and traffic conditions have a significant impact on cell lifetimes. In addition, a stage of accelerated capacity fade was observed and shown to be induced by an increased loss of lithium inventory (LLI) resulting from irreversible Li plating. New metrics, the ratio of the loss of active material at the negative electrode (LAMNE) to the LLI and the plating threshold, were proposed as possible predictors for a stage of accelerated degradation. The results presented here demonstrated tracking properties, such as capacity loss and resistance increase, were insufficient in predicting cell lifetimes, supporting the adoption of metrics based on the analysis of degradation modes.},

Destructive physical analyses and ex situ electrochemical analyses were performed at test completion on selected cells. While no change in positive morphology and performance was detected, significant cracking and delamination of the carbon negative was observed. In addition, X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the changes in the crystal structure of the graphite during cycling. The degradation of the carbon negative is consistent with the observations from the electrochemical analysis. Ex situ electrochemical analysis confirmed that active lithium controlled cell capacity and its loss with cycling directly correlated with cell degradation.

	abstract = {SEI growth in lithium-ion batteries is commonly assumed to scale with t0.5, in line with simple models of diffusion-limited surface layer growth. As a result, this model is widely used for empirical predictions of capacity fade in lithium-ion batteries. However, the t0.5 model is generally not theoretically sufficient to describe all of the various SEI growth modes. Furthermore, previous literature has not convincingly demonstrated that this model provides the best fit to measurements of SEI growth. In this work, we discuss the theoretical assumptions of the t0.5 model, evaluate claims of t0.5 dependence in six previously published datasets and one new dataset, and compare the performance of this model to that of other models. We find that few of the purported t0.5 fits in literature are statistically justified, although t0.5 generally describes SEI growth during storage better than SEI growth during cycling. Finally, we evaluate how the fitted exponents in the power-law models vary as a function of time, and we illustrate the limitations of using t0.5 for prediction without validating its applicability to a particular dataset. This work illustrates the theoretical and empirical limitations of the t0.5 model and highlights alternatives for more accurate estimates and predictions of SEI growth.},

            State-of-health (SOH) is an essential parameter for the proper functioning of large battery packs. A wide array of methodologies has been proposed in the literature to track state of health, but they often lack the proper validation that needed to be universally adaptable to large deployed systems. This is likely induced by the lack of knowledge bridge between scientists, who understand batteries, and engineers, who understand controls. In this work, we will attempt to bridge this gap by providing definitions, concepts, and tools to apply necessary material science knowledge to advanced battery management systems (BMS). We will address SOH determination and prediction, as well as BMS implementation and validation using the mechanistic framework developed around electrochemical voltage spectroscopies. Particular focus will be set on the onset and the prediction of the second stage of accelerating capacity loss that is commonly observed in commercial lithium-ion batteries.},

We report on the relations between capacity’s knees, IR’s elbows and end of life for the large dataset of the study. We enhance our discussion with two applications. We use neural network techniques to build independent state of health capacity and IR predictor models achieving a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.4\% and 1.6\%, respectively, and an overall root mean squared error below 0.0061.

Here we present a physicochemical pseudo-3D model that explicitly includes the plating reaction as side reaction running in parallel to the main intercalation reaction. The thermodynamics of the plating reaction are modeled depending on temperature and ion concentration, which differs from the often-used assumption of a constant plating condition of 0 V anode potential. The reaction kinetics are described with an Arrhenius-type rate law parameterized from an extensive literature research. Re-intercalation of plated lithium was modeled to take place either via reverse plating (solution-mediated) or via an explicit interfacial reaction (surface-mediated). At low temperatures not only the main processes (intercalation and solid-state diffusion) become slow, but also the plating reaction itself becomes slower. Using this model, we are able to predict typical macroscopic experimental observables that are indicative of plating, that is, a voltage plateau during discharge and a voltage drop upon temperature increase. A spatiotemporal analysis of the internal cell states allows a quantitative insight into the competition between intercalation and plating. Finally, we calculate operation maps over a wide range of C-rates and temperatures that allow to assess plating propensity as function of operating condition.},

Preventing metallic lithium from forming is difficult, as the heterogeneity of materials typically used in batteries can create transport non-uniformities, which can lead to unanticipated local plating. Therefore, being able to predict the occurrence of plating due to a non-uniformity of a certain shape and size becomes essential. In this study, we probe the importance of the size scale and geometry on localized plating through numerical simulations and experiments. Using modified separators to create transport non-uniformities, we show that certain geometric features lead to more vulnerability to plating, and localization strongly depends on size. A single large feature in a separator induces more plating than a collection of smaller features with same total area. Our findings help elucidate the fundamentals behind heterogeneous plating, which can provide practical insights into battery safety and product control.},

          , 
            Improvement of the performance of Li metal anodes is critical to enable high energy density rechargeable battery systems beyond Li-ion. However, a complete mechanistic understanding of electrode overpotential variations that occur during extended cycling of Li metal is lacking. Herein, we demonstrate that when using a Li metal electrode, the dynamic changes in voltage during extended cycles can be increasingly attributed to mass transport. It is shown that these mass transport effects arise as a result of dead Li accumulation at the Li metal electrode, which introduces a tortuous pathway for Li-ion transport. In Li–Li symmetric cells, mass transport effects cause the shape of the galvanostatic voltage response to change from “peaking” to “arcing”, along with an increase in total electrode overpotential. The continued accumulation of dead Li is also conclusively shown to directly cause capacity fade and rapid “failure” of Li–LCO full cells containing Li metal anodes. This work provides detailed insights into the coupled relationships between cycling, interphase morphology, mass transport and the overall cell performance. Furthermore, this work helps underscore the potential of Li–Li symmetric cells as a powerful analytical tool for understanding the effects of Li metal electrodes in full cell batteries.},

A mechanical model is proposed based on a system made of a spherical graphite particle surrounded by the solid electrolyte interphase layer. During lithium intercalation or de-intercalation, stresses in the graphite are produced, governed by the diffusion induced stress phenomena and in the solid electrolyte interphase, driven by the graphite expansion. The stresses in both materials were simulated and a sensitivity analysis was performed to clarify the inﬂuence of principal parameters on both processes. Finally, assuming that the solid electrolyte interphase is the weakest material and therefore more prone to fracture than graphite, the experimental capacity fade during cycling was modeled based on its break and repair effect rather than on the fracture of the active material. The mechanical model of the solid electrolyte interphase was implemented in a single particle lithium ion battery model in order to reproduce capacity fade during battery lifetime. The model results were compared against cycle life aging experimental data, reproducing accurately the inﬂuence of the depth of discharge as well as the average state of charge on the capacity fade.},

	abstract = {Before lithium-ion batteries are purchased in volume, they are typically tested (qualiﬁed) to determine if they meet the life-cycle reliability requirements for the targeted applications. To ensure that subsequent production lots of batteries continue to meet the reliability requirements, ongoing reliability testing is often conducted on production lot samples. However, a key challenge is how to quickly determine if the samples have substantially similar reliability as those batteries that were initially qualiﬁed, and, in particular, how to detect early signs of unacceptable degradation. This paper uses ﬁve data-driven methods (regression model with prediction bound, one-class support vector machine, local outlier factor, Mahalanobis distance, and sequential probability ratio test) to detect anomalous degradation behavior of samples from actual production lots subjected to ongoing reliability tests. An ensemble approach was then developed because it was observed that no single method always gave the earliest warning. The approach can be used by device companies for warranty, recall, and technical decisions.},

Compared to traditional cycling, failure was reached up to 3.5 times faster. When this protocol was applied to cells containing low LiPF6 concentrations (≤ 0.4 M) failure was achieved up to 17.5 times faster than traditional cycling with normal LiPF6 concentrations. This represents a time improvement on the order of years and therefore can be used as a high-throughput screening method. Failure mechanisms for cells containing a range of LiPF6 concentrations undergoing these aggressive protocols were investigated using charge-discharge cycling, impedance spectroscopy (including symmetric cell analysis) and isothermal microcalorimetry. Long times at high voltage rapidly increase positive electrode impedance but do not seem to consume lithium inventory. The use of lower LiPF6 concentrations does not seem to introduce new failure mechanisms but makes cells less tolerant to positive electrode impedance growth. The utility of this method is demonstrated by screening cells with a variety of electrolyte additive combinations. Fewer than 3 months were required to distinguish cells containing 1\% lithium difluorophospate as superior to cells with other additive combinations.},

	abstract = {Lithium ion cells, when cycled, exhibit a two-stage degradation behavior characterized by a first linear stage and a second nonlinear stage where degradation is rapid. The multitude of degradation phenomena occurring in lithium ion batteries complicates the understanding of this two-stage degradation behavior. In this work, a simple and intuitive model is presented to analyze the coupled effect of resistance growth and the shape of the state of charge (SOC)-open circuit voltage (OCV) relationship in representing the complete degradation behavior. The model simulations demonstrate that a single resistance that increases linearly on cycling can capture the transition from slow to fast degradation, primarily due to the shape of the SOC-OCV curve. Further, the model simulations indicate that the shape of the degradation curve depends strongly on the magnitude of current at the end of discharge of the cycling protocol. To verify these observations, specific experiments are designed with minimal capacity loss but with shrinking operating voltage ranges that result in shrinking operating OCV range. The results of the experiments validate the observations of model simulations. Further, long-term cycling experiment with a commercial lithium ion cell shows that the operating OCV range shrinks substantially with aging and is a major reason for the observed accelerated degradation. The analysis of the present work provides significant insights towards developing simple semiempirical models suitable for battery life management in microcontrollers.},

Due to the low efficiency of the lithium plating/stripping process relative to the intercalation/deintercalation of lithium from graphite, small amounts of lithium plating can be detected through high accuracy measurements of coulombic efficiency. In this study, coulombic efficiency versus charging rate was measured at different temperatures and for two cell types. Small changes to the coulombic efficiency during cycling resulting from small amounts of lithium plating during the charging process were detected using a high precision charger. Cells were disassembled and examined to confirm the presence of lithium plating at the rates predicted to cause plating. This work shows how high precision coulometry can be used to maximize the performance of the cell through battery management by varying the maximum charge rate as a function of temperature to avoid lithium plating.},

In particular, systems based on lithium-ion batteries have evolved rapidly with a wide range of cell technologies and system architectures available on the market. On the application side, different tasks for storage deployment demand distinct properties of the storage system. This review aims to serve as a guideline for best choice of battery technology, system design and operation for lithium-ion based storage systems to match a specific system application. Starting with an overview to lithium-ion battery technologies and their characteristics with respect to performance and aging, the storage system design is analyzed in detail based on an evaluation of real-world projects. Typical storage system applications are grouped and classified with respect to the challenges posed to the battery system. Publicly available modeling tools for technical and economic analysis are presented. A brief analysis of optimization approaches aims to point out challenges and potential solution techniques for system sizing, positioning and dispatch operation. For all areas reviewed herein, expected improvements and possible future developments are highlighted. In order to extract the full potential of stationary battery storage systems and to enable increased profitability of systems, future research should aim to a holistic system level approach combining not only performance tuning on a battery cell level and careful analysis of the application requirements, but also consider a proper selection of storage sub-components as well as an optimized system operation strategy.},

	abstract = {By starting from fundamental principles, the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of electrodeposited anode materials is analyzed. Thermodynamically, we show that an overpotential-controlled critical radius has to be overcome in order for dendrite formation to become energetically favorable. Kinetically, surface tension and overpotential driving forces define a critical kinetic radius above which an isolated embryo will grow and below which it will shrink. As a result, five regimes of behavior are identified: nucleation suppression regime, long incubation time regime, short incubation time regime, early growth regime, and late growth regime. In the nucleation suppression regime, embryos are thermodynamically unstable and unable to persist. For small overpotentials, below a critical overpotential, 2 eta(o), and between the thermodynamic and kinetic critical radius, a metastable regime exists where the local electrochemically enabled Gibbs-Thomson interactions control the coarsening of the embryos, thus defining the long incubation time regime. In addition, very broad nuclei size distributions are favored. For large overpotentials, above 2 eta(o), a short incubation time regime develops as a result of the small energy barrier and large galvanostatic driving forces. In addition, very narrow size. distributions of nuclei are favored. In the early growth regime, thermodynamically and kinetically favored nuclei grow to reach an asymptotic growth velocity. Finally, in the late growth regime, morphological instabilities and localized electric fields dominate the morphology and microstructural evolution of the deposit.},

Here, we determine the fundamental mechanism for the onset of lithium plating on graphite particles. We perform in situ optical microscopy coupled with electrochemical measurements to resolve the spatial dynamics of lithiation and plating on the surface of a single graphite particle. We observe that the onset of plating is strongly coupled with phase separation in graphite and occurs only on the fully lithiated edges of the particles. The competition between Li insertion and plating is further elucidated by examining the energetics and kinetics of both reactions. Based on the physical insights drawn from the experiments, we propose a phase-ﬁeld model that predicts the onset of Li plating.},

	abstract = {Lithium metal has re-emerged as an exciting anode for high energy lithium-ion batteries due to its high speciﬁc capacity of 3860 mAh g−1 and lowest electrochemical potential of all known materials. However, lithium has been plagued by the issues of dendrite formation, high chemical reactivity with electrolyte, and inﬁnite relative volume expansion during plating and stripping, which present safety hazards and low cycling eﬃciency in batteries with lithium metal electrodes. There have been a lot of recent studies on Li metal although little work has focused on the initial nucleation and growth behavior of Li metal, neglecting a critical fundamental scientiﬁc foundation of Li plating. Here, we study experimentally the morphology of lithium in the early stages of nucleation and growth on planar copper electrodes in liquid organic electrolyte. We elucidate the dependence of lithium nuclei size, shape, and areal density on current rate, consistent with classical nucleation and growth theory. We found that the nuclei size is proportional to the inverse of overpotential and the number density of nuclei is proportional to the cubic power of overpotential. Based on this understanding, we propose a strategy to increase the uniformity of electrodeposited lithium on the electrode surface.},

Statistical analysis of mechanical and aging data revealed significant nonlinear (interaction) effects of both factors on pressure evolution, capacity loss and increase in internal resistance of the cells. Pressure dependent cell aging is observed over 1000 cycles, which was related to loss of active material at the cathode from differential voltage analysis. Post-mortem analysis confirmed a cathode active material loss via half- and full-cell measurements of harvested electrodes. Cross-section SEM micrographs revealed increasing NMC-particle cracking with higher pressure. Based on this, a fatigue-based aging model was developed to describe the capacity loss due to pressure dependent particle cracking.

	abstract = {The Solid-Electrolyte-Interphase (SEI) model for non-aqueous alkali-metal batteries constitutes a paradigm change in the understanding of lithium batteries and has thus enabled the development of safer, durable, higher-power and lower-cost lithium batteries for portable and EV applications. Prior to the publication of the SEI model (1979), researchers used the Butler-Volmer equation, in which a direct electron transfer from the electrode to lithium cations in the solution is assumed. The SEI model proved that this is a mistaken concept and that, in practice, the transfer of electrons from the electrode to the solution in a lithium battery, must be prevented, since it will result in fast self-discharge of the active materials and poor battery performance. This model provides [E. Peled, in “Lithium Batteries,” J.P. Gabano (ed), Academic Press, (1983), E. Peled, J. Electrochem. Soc., 126, 2047 (1979).] new equations for: electrode kinetics (io and b), anode corrosion, SEI resistivity and growth rate and irreversible capacity loss of lithium-ion batteries. This model became a cornerstone in the science and technology of lithium batteries. This paper reviews the past, present and the future of SEI batteries.},

	abstract = {The lifetime of the battery significantly influences the acceptance of electric vehicles. Calendar aging contributes to the limited operating lifetime of lithium-ion batteries. Therefore, its consideration in addition to cyclical aging is essential to understand battery degradation. This study consequently examines the same graphite/NCA pouch cell that was the subject of previously published cyclic aging tests. The cells were aged at different temperatures and states of charge. The self-discharge was continuously monitored, and after each storage period, the remaining capacity and the impedance were measured. The focus of this publication is on the correlation of the measurements. An aging correlation is obtained that is valid for a wide range of temperatures and states of charge. The results show an accelerated capacity fade and impedance rise with increasing temperature, following the law of Arrhenius. However, the obtained data do also indicate that there is no path dependency, i.e., earlier periods at different temperature levels do not affect the present degradation rate. A large impact of the storage state of charge at 100\% is evident, whereas the influence is small below 80\%. Instead of the commonly applied square root of the time function, our results are in excellent agreement with an exponential function.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion battery formation affects battery cost, energy density, and lifetime. An improved understanding of the first cycle of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth on carbonaceous negative electrodes could aid in the design of optimized formation protocols. In this work, we systematically study SEI growth during the formation of carbon black negative electrodes in a standard carbonate electrolyte. We show that the initial ethylene carbonate (EC) reduction reaction occurs at ∼0.5–1.2 V during the first lithiation, except under fast lithiation rates (≥10C). The products of this EC reduction reaction do not passivate the electrode; only the SEI formed at lower potentials affects the second-cycle Coulombic efficiency. Thus, cycling quickly through the voltage regime of this reaction can decrease both formation time and first-cycle capacity loss, without an increase in subsequent-cycle capacity loss. We also show that the capacity consumed by this reaction is minimized at low temperatures and low salt concentrations. Finally, we discuss the mechanism behind our experimental results. This work reveals the fundamental processes underlying initial SEI growth on carbonaceous negative electrodes and provides insights for both optimizing the battery formation process and enabling novel electrolytes.},

              X-ray diffraction profilometry is used to characterize spatial distribution of the active materials, lithiation, and phase distribution in electrodes of NCM523/graphite coin cells. The X-ray data indicate uneven areal compression of the electrode assembly in such cells, which we trace to a specific design feature that leads to elastic deformation of a metal spacer. Steep lithiation gradients observed in the electrodes imply radially-dependent resistivity, for which uneven compression of the separator is a likely cause. Electrochemical model calculations suggest that variable porosity of the polymer separator would account for the salient features of spatial profiles observed in these coin cells.},

The Butler-Volmer exchange current is consistently expressed in terms of the activities of the reduced, oxidized and transition states, and the activation overpotential is defined relative to the local Nernst potential. We also apply mathematical bounds on effective diffusivity to estimate porosity and tortuosity corrections. The theory is illustrated for a Li-ion battery with active solid particles described by a Cahn-Hilliard phase-field model. Depending on the applied current and porous electrode properties, the dynamics can be limited by electrolyte transport, solid diffusion and phase separation, or intercalation kinetics. In phase-separating porous electrodes, the model predicts narrow reaction fronts, mosaic instabilities and voltage fluctuations at low current, consistent with recent experiments, which could not be described by existing porous electrode models.},

Aging was observed as capacity fade and resistance increase, and the aging mechanisms were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and post-mortem analysis, where visual inspection and thickness measurements were employed together with X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analyses. It was observed that elevated temperatures resulted in accelerated capacity fade, especially for the +45 °C/+65 °C condition. SEI-layer growth and lithium plating, discovered in cell disassembly, were attributed to be the main mechanisms responsible for capacity loss. In addition to the capacity fade, resistance increase was observed both in ohmic and polarization resistances. The ohmic resistance growth was attributed to lack of electrolyte and increased separator resistance. Polarization resistance evolution during cycling was similar at room temperature and at +45 °C, but different at the +45 °C/+65 °C condition. It was concluded that post-mortem analysis is essential for attributing the cycle testing and impedance spectroscopy results to different components and processes inside the cell. For example, the lithium plating phenomenon could not have been predicted or discovered without disassembling the cells.},

In this work, we investigate the effects of current density on localized plating through experimental studies and numerical simulations, and demonstrate the plating results using LCO/graphite coin cells. As the current density increases, the critical size that triggers non-uniform plating decreases, and we directly correlate size and current density to capacity fade of a battery. We also identify transitions from no plating, to heterogeneous plating, and to homogeneous plating. We show that diffusion plays a critical role in the aggregation of lithium, and the critical size is negatively correlated with current density and the effective diffusion length.

The sphere shape results in a heterogenic pressure distribution on the lithium-ion battery and induces a ring of locally high electrochemical activity, which leads to lithium plating. Furthermore, a surface layer found on the anode, which is a possible cause of electrolyte degradation at the particle–electrolyte interface. Significant deformation and destruction of particles by the local pressure was observed on the cathode.

In this work, we investigate the full-cell evolution of lithium-ion batteries using two complementary techniques, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and ultrasonic time-of-ﬂight analysis, which make it possible to couple electrochemical and material property changes during cycling. It is found that there is a post-formation ‘‘break-in’’ period before full-cell behavior stabilizes. This period is signiﬁed by an increased swelling of the graphite anode, likely caused by side reactions, which increases the pressure within the cell. The increased pressure forces electrolyte to wet previously inactive portions of the lithium cobalt oxide cathode, lowering the cell impedance. The results demonstrate how the full-cell performance can be greatly affected by non-chemical crosstalk between the two electrodes and indicates the importance of using multiple complementary experimental techniques.},

	abstract = {In this contribution a simple in-situ method named capacity difference analysis (CDA) is introduced to characterize lateral flow of lithium-ions within the anode. Therefore, simply the difference between two capacity measurements, which are determined at significantly different current rates, are evaluated for each check-up. During aging the initial capacity difference of 2–3\% is reducing for all calendaric and cyclic aged cells until they reach a value which is close to zero difference. The initial capacity difference can be explained by lithium-ion flow between active and passive anode, whereby passive represents the excess anode without counter cathode (passive electrode effect). The successive reduction is likely caused by particle disconnection between active and passive anode and/or dry out of electrolyte in the anode overhang. Furthermore some cyclic aged cells reveal an increase after the initial decrease which can be associated to a process of forming a vertical deposition layer on top of the anode facing the separator that is not permeable to lithium-ions applying reasonable discharge currents. The CDA results are validated by laser microscope imaging after disassembling representative cells. The method is applied on a test matrix presented in our previous publication [1].},

	abstract = {Batteries are combinations of electrochemical cells that generate electricity to power electrical devices. Batteries are continuously converting chemical energy to electrical energy, and require appropriate maintenance to provide maximum efﬁciency. Management systems having specialized monitoring features; such as charge controlling mechanisms and temperature regulation are used to prevent health, safety, and property hazards that complement the use of batteries. These systems utilize measures of merit to regulate battery performances. Figures such as the state-of-health (SOH) and state-of-charge (SOC) are used to estimate the performance and state of the battery. In this paper, we propose an intelligent method to investigate the aforementioned parameters using a data-driven approach. We use a machine learning algorithm that extracts signiﬁcant features from the discharge curves to estimate these parameters. Extensive simulations have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed method under different currents and temperatures.},

The capacity losses were estimated after 300 cycles at 2C and 3C discharge rates and were found to be 13.2 and 16.9\% of the initial capacity, respectively. At 1C discharge rate the capacity lost was only 9.5\%. The cell cycled at high discharge rate (3C) showed the largest internal resistance increase of 27.7\% relative to the resistance of the fresh cells. The rate capability losses were proportional with the increase of discharge rates. Half-cell study and material and charge balances were used to quantify the capacity fade due to the losses of primary active material (Li+), the secondary active material (LiCoO2/C)) and rate capability losses. It was found that carbon with 10.6\% capacity loss after 300 cycles dominates the capacity fade of the whole cell at high discharge rates (3C). A mechanism is proposed which explains the capacity fade at high discharge rates.},

	abstract = {This paper represents the evaluation of ageing parameters in lithium iron phosphate based batteries, through investigating different current rates, working temperatures and depths of discharge. From these analyses, one can derive the impact of the working temperature on the battery performances over its lifetime. At elevated temperature (40°C), the performances are less compared to at 25°C. The obtained mathematical expression of the cycle life as function of the operating temperature reveals that the well-known Arrhenius law cannot be applied to derive the battery lifetime from one temperature to another. Moreover, a number of cycle life tests have been performed to illustrate the long-term capabilities of the proposed battery cells at different discharge constant current rates. The results reveal the harmful impact of high current rates on battery characteristics. On the other hand, the cycle life test at different depth of discharge levels indicates that the battery is able to perform 3221 cycles (till 80\% DoD) compared to 34,957 shallow cycles (till 20\% DoD). To investigate the cycle life capabilities of lithium iron phosphate based battery cells during fast charging, cycle life tests have been carried out at different constant charge current rates. The experimental analysis indicates that the cycle life of the battery degrades the more the charge current rate increases. From this analysis, one can conclude that the studied lithium iron based battery cells are not recommended to be charged at high current rates. This phenomenon affects the viability of ultra-fast charging systems. Finally, a cycle life model has been developed, which is able to predict the battery cycleability accurately.},

Operando cell-stack pressure measurements performed on constrained pouch cells reveal a correlation between irreversible volume expansion and capacity loss caused by a continually thickening SEI. Several silicon-containing full-cell chemistries—LCO/graphite:Si-alloy, NCA/graphite:SiO, and NCA/Si:C—as well as a conventional NMC/graphite cell chemistry were investigated. The effect of FEC consumption on catastrophic failure was also investigated by comparing cells containing 10\% FEC and 1\% FEC. We show that once FEC is depleted, passivation failure occurs, resulting in massive, irreversible expansion indicating runaway SEI thickening and concomitant cell failure. This work demonstrates that irreversible volume expansion caused by SEI growth can be detected with operando pressure measurements, thus presenting a valuable tool for studying the degradation of Li-ion pouch cells and ranking the performance of different cell chemistries.},

Moreover, a detailed assessment of charging strategies is performed, based on an extensive experimental study with three different cell types. The experimental results reveal that the impact of charging currents and charging voltages on cycle life can vary markedly among different lithium-ion batteries. In general, the cycle life is influenced more by high charging currents than by high discharging currents. Different boost charging protocols have disclosed that high charging currents can deteriorate cycle life not only at high state of charge (SoC), but also at very low SoC. Our investigations on pulse charging show that lithium-ion cells withstand charging pulses of high current or high voltage without any deterioration in cycle life, when the duration of the pulses remains short and the mean current and voltage values are considerably lower. For pulses of less than 1s, cycle life has been similar for pulsed and continuous charging with the same mean charging currents and identical cycle depths. This paper also presents the impact of charging currents and charging voltages on capacity utilization, charging time, and efficiency to support the development process of optimized charging protocols for practical applications.},

In this work several post-mortem analyses of cyclic aged cylindrical LFPjGraphite cells are evaluated to give a detailed characterization of the covering layer and to ﬁnd possible causes for the evolution of such a layer. The analyses of the layer with different methods return that it consists to high percentage of plated active lithium, deposited Fe and products of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The deposition is located mainly in the center of the cell symmetrical to the coating direction. The origin of these depositions is assumed in locally overcharged particles, Fe deposition or inhomogeneous distribution of capacity density. As a secondary effect the deposition on one side increases the thickness locally; thereafter a pressure-induced overcharging due to charge agglomeration of the back side of the anode occurs. Finally a compact and dense covering layer in a late state of aging leads to deactivation of the covered parts of the anode and cathode due to suppressed lithium-ion conductivity. This leads to increasing slope of capacity fade and increase of internal resistance.},

The test matrix includes a variation of possible influencing factors like current rates during cycling as well as tem- perature and state of charge during rest periods, rest period length and number of cycles between rest periods. A significant capacity recovery during rest periods is measured after cycling at moderate temperatures which
has only been reported for low temperature lithium plating experiments before. Rest periods were conducted at 100\% state of charge, thus the anode overhang effect can be excluded as the cause for the observed capacity increase. Voltage relaxation tests indicate that lithium plating occurs due to high current rates. Furthermore, a microscopic model is proposed to explain the long time constant of the limited exponential capacity increase during rest periods. Under these plating conditions a significant increase in cell cycle lifetime is observed if regular rest periods or standard characterizations are applied.},

The exact state of health of a battery is still a major challenge for analysis, especially since the individual ageing factors are not well understood and depend on the cell chemistry and design. In this analysis, X-ray computer tomographic (CT) images of new and aged battery electrodes are compared to determine structural changes over lifetime. The X-ray CT images with sub-micrometer resolution show the internal pore structure of the electrodes and allow the identification of the morphology of the materials. Organic residues and depositions responsible for reduced porosity in aged anodes are quantified and visualized. Furthermore, particle cracking and current collector corrosion is detected on the cathode side. All these are ageing effects, which might influence the cell capacity and impedance. A quantitative analysis of the lithium distribution completes the interpretation of the ageing study confirming that the degradation can be attributed to the loss of cyclable lithium which is bound in the particle surface layer of the anode.},

Thus, effective management and control of a battery system to allow efficient, reliable, and safe operation becomes vital, and diagnostic and prognostic tools are essential. Yet, developing these tools in practical applications is new to the industry, difficult and challenging. Here we present a novel mechanistic model that can enable battery diagnosis and prognosis. The model can simulate various “what-if” scenarios of battery degradation modes via a synthetic approach based on specific electrode behavior with proper adjustment of the loading ratio and the extent of degradation in and between the two electrodes. This approach is very different from the conventional empirical ones that correlate the cell parameters (such as impedance increases) with degradation in capacity or power fade to predict performance and life. This approach, with mechanistic understanding of battery degradation processes and failure mechanisms, offers unique high-fidelity simulation to address path dependence of the battery degradation.},

The DOE is based on the competitive comparison of specific current profiles under repeated application to the tested cell format. The current profiles are obtained from the linear superposition of a constant current profile and four independent, charge-neutral profiles modulating the shape of the base profile. The charge-neutral profiles rely on physically meaningful assumptions about their beneficial effects for the charging procedure, e.g. that a superimposed alternating current (AC) profile reduces unwanted polarization by its intrinsic heat generation. The aging minimal profiles are identified by multiple regression analysis. Mechanistic degradation analysis is applied to study the root cause of the observed capacity roll-over of the cells after a specific cycle number. This roll-over is attributed to the occurrence of lithium plating which itself is driven by active material losses in the initial stages of the cycle life. The onset of the roll-over can be considerably delayed by a suitable choice of the current trajectory, resulting in a more than doubled life expectancy.},

	abstract = {For alternative vehicles, such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs), the high cost of lithium-ion battery packs is one of the major impediments to their market development. Due to the degradation of batteries in the vehicle, their life cycle comes to an end when the energy capacity is not sufﬁcient to fulﬁll the designed requirements for the vehicle. However, the capacity left in the batteries can still be reused for other energy storage applications that support the management of electrical system. The second use of electric vehicle batteries depends on precise forecast of State-of-Health (SOH) in the future. In this paper, a SOH prediction approach is proposed based on autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. At ﬁrst, through proper selection of model orders, a time series model is estimated based on the training data of previous SOH records. Next, the forecast is performed, and the prediction residue is analyzed to evaluate the obtained model by verifying whether the residue is white noise or not. A case study of battery aging test is conducted to validate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of the proposed approach.},
