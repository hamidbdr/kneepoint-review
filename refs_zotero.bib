	abstract = {The requirement for energy density of lithium-ion batteries becomes more urgent due to the rising demand for driving range of electric vehicles in recent years. Meanwhile, the performance stability of batteries with high energy densities tends to deteriorate, leading to accelerating degradation and safety issues. As a result, it is critical to explore the reasons that yield the sudden degradation and to recognize the degradation knee point of Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese batteries commonly used for electric vehicles. Existing results have disclosed that the lithium deposition of negative electrode dominates the sudden degradation of battery capacity. This paper extracts key parameters that characterize the aging status to facilitate knee point recognition in engineering practice. Furthermore, a novel method that integrates quantile regression and Monte Carlo simulation method to identify the accelerated fading knee point is introduced. The dynamic safety boundary determination method for the whole battery lifetime is proposed to update and monitor the safety zone. It is verified by experiments that the recognition results of capacity degradation knee point appear within 90–95\% capacity range at 25 °C, 35 °C and 45 °C conditions, which can provide an early warning before the battery fails. Using the proposed method for recognizing the sudden degradation of capacity, recognition result is effective even if the input is disturbed and has strong reliability and stability under different conditions. It is helpful to promote the sustainable and stable development of the electric vehicles and improve advanced applied energy technologies.},

	abstract = {The maximum energy that lithium-ion batteries can store decreases as they are used because of various irreversible degradation mechanisms. Many models of degradation have been proposed in the literature, sometimes with a small experimental data set for validation. However, a comprehensive comparison between different model predictions is lacking, making it difficult to select modelling approaches which can explain the degradation trends actually observed from data. Here, various degradation models from literature are implemented within a single particle model framework and their behavior is compared. It is shown that many different models can be fitted to a small experimental data set. The interactions between different models are simulated, showing how some of the models accelerate degradation in other models, altering the overall degradation trend. The effects of operating conditions on the various degradation models is simulated. This identifies which models are enhanced by which operating conditions and might therefore explain specific degradation trends observed in data. Finally, it is shown how a combination of different models is needed to capture different degradation trends observed in a large experimental data set. Vice versa, only a large data set enables to properly select the models which best explain the observed degradation.},

Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and Grid-to-vehicle (G2V) strategies are often cited as promising approaches to mitigate the intermittency of renewable energy on electric power grids. However, their impact on vehicle battery degradation have yet to be investigated in detail. Since battery degradation is path dependent, i.e. different usage schedules lead to different degradation mechanisms, it is essential to investigate batteries u nder realistic V2G and G2V scenarios. The aim of this work is to understand the effect of bidirectional charging on the degradation mechanisms of commercial Li-ion cells used in electric vehicles today. Results showed that an extra V2G step during cycle-aging accelerated capacity loss and degraded the kinetics at the negative electrode. Moreover, for all cycling duty cycles, the loss of active material at the negative electrode was higher than the loss of lithium inventory. This condition could trigger lithium plating and shorten cell lifetimes. In the calendar-aging experiments, state of charge was shown to be an important factor and interacted with temperature to accelerate the loss of active material at the positive electrode and the loss of lithium. It was also found that high state of charge values caused loss of active material at the negative electrode and kinetic limitations.},

	abstract = {Summary Li-ion batteries based on Ni-rich layered cathodes are the state-of-the-art technology for electric vehicles; however, batteries using these advanced materials suffer from rapid performance fading. In this work, we report a critical turning point during the aging of graphite/LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) full cells, after which the degradation is significantly accelerated. This turning point was identified using differential voltage analysis (DVA) applied to standard two-electrode data, which shows that graphite becomes progressively less lithiated, as confirmed by operando long-duration X-ray diffraction, and therefore has a higher electrochemical potential at the end of charge. This increase leads to a proportional increase in the cathode potential, and an accelerated impedance increase is observed from this point. This mechanism is expected to be universal for the vast majority of Li-ion battery chemistries, particularly for Ni-rich cathodes, whose degradation is extremely sensitive to the upper cutoff voltage, and our work provides fundamental guidelines for developing effective countermeasures.},

	abstract = {Forecasting the lifetime of Li-ion batteries is a critical challenge that limits the integration of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) into the automotive market. Cycle-life performance of Li-ion batteries is intrinsically linked to the fundamental understanding of ageing mechanisms. In contrast to most previous studies which utilise empirical trends (low real-time information) or rough simplifications on mathematical models to predict the lifetime of a Li-ion battery, we deployed a novel ageing formulation that includes heterogeneous dual-layer solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and lithium-plating ageing mechanisms with porosity evaluation. The proposed model is parameterized and optimized for mass transport and ageing parameters based on fresh and an aged cell and validated against our experimental results. We show that our advanced ageing mechanisms can accurately calculate experimentally observed cell voltage and capacity fade with respect to cycling number and can predict future fade for new operating scenarios based on constant-current and a dynamic power profile cycling exper­ imental data consisting of high discharge C-rates and fast-charging periods. Our model is able to capture the linear and nonlinear (knee-point) capacity fade characteristics with a high accuracy of 98\% goodness-of-fit-error and we compared our model performance with well-accepted existing model in literature.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the origin of the jelly roll deformation in 18650 lithium-ion batteries is examined in more detail by combining volume expansion measurements, accelerated lifetime testing, and CT imaging. Based on the presented research, a theory is developed to determine the cause of the jelly roll deformation at low states of charge (0-20 \% SOC). The diameter of the cell is increasing during ageing, which reflects the increase of the internal pressure. Continuously growing cover layers of chemical degradation explain the latter. It is concluded that for releasing internal pressure, the jelly roll starts to deform. This deformation accelerates the ageing processes by electrically isolating active material from the current collector and the formation of fresh SEI. In addition, the CT images are used to determine the time of the deformation. Conclusively, it is shown that the jelly roll deformation is driven by cyclic ageing. Due to the correlation of the mean diameter change and the capacity curve, the deformation of the jelly roll and thus the sudden cell death can be predicted by measuring the mean diameter change of the battery.},

Prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of such sources is vital to improve the safety and reliability of battery-powered systems. Even though several prognostic methods have been extensively explored for the RUL prediction of lithium-ion batteries, these methods are focused on adopting a single empirical / phenomenological degradation model which best describes the degradation behavior. However, certain lithium-ion battery materials exhibit two distinct degradation behaviors with an evident inﬂection point. In such cases, a single empirical model no longer holds good. Hence, we propose a piecewise degradation model along with a novel methodology to determine the inﬂection point. The proposed model is incorporated into a particle ﬁlter framework to predict the battery’s degradation trajectories. The effectiveness of the proposed model is veriﬁed by adding a 50dB noise to the measurement data. The prognostic results of the proposed piecewise model are compared with the existing single empirical model. We use prediction error and execution time as the prognostic metrics for comparison.},

	abstract = {High-performance batteries greatly benefit from accurate, early predictions of future capacity loss, to advance the management of the battery and sustain desirable application-specific performance characteristics for as long as possible. Li-ion cells exhibit a slow capacity degradation up to a knee-point, after which the degradation accelerates rapidly until the cell’s End-of-Life. Using capacity degradation data, we propose a robust method to identify the knee-point within capacity fade curves. In a new approach to knee research, we propose the concept ‘knee-onset’, marking the beginning of the nonlinear degradation, and provide a simple and robust identification mechanism for it. We link cycle life, knee-point and knee-onset, where predicting/identifying one promptly reveals the others. On data featuring continuous high C-rate cycling (1C–8C), we show that, on average, the knee-point occurs at 95\% capacity under these conditions and the knee-onset at 97.1\% capacity, with knee and its onset on average 108 cycles apart. After the critical identification step, we employ machine learning (ML) techniques for early prediction of the knee-point and knee-onset. Our models predict knee-point and knee-onset quantitatively with 9.4\% error using only information from the first 50 cycles of the cells’ life. Our models use the knee-point predictions to classify the cells’ expected cycle lives as short, medium or long with 88–90\% accuracy using only information from the first 3–5 cycles. Our accuracy levels are on par with existing literature for End-of-Life prediction (requiring information from 100-cycles), nonetheless, we address the more complex problem of knee prediction. All estimations are enriched with confidence/credibility metrics. The uncertainty regarding the ML model’s estimations is quantified through prediction intervals. These yield risk-criteria insurers and manufacturers of energy storage applications can use for battery warranties. Our classification model provides a tool for cell manufacturers to speed up the validation of cell production techniques.},

	abstract = {A physics-based Li-ion battery (LIB) aging model accounting for both lithium plating and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth is presented, and is applied to study the aging behavior of a cell undergoing prolonged cycling at moderate operating conditions. Cell aging is found to be linear in the early stage of cycling but highly nonlinear in the end with rapid capacity drop and resistance rise. The linear aging stage is found to be dominated by SEI growth, while the transition from linear to nonlinear aging is attributed to the sharp rise of lithium plating rate. Lithium plating starts to occur in a narrow portion of the anode near the separator after a certain number of cycles. The onset of lithium plating is attributed to the drop of anode porosity associated with SEI growth, which aggravates the local electrolyte potential gradient in the anode. The presence of lithium metal accelerates the porosity reduction, further promoting lithium plating. This positive feedback leads to exponential increase of lithium plating rate in the late stage of cycling, as well as local pore clogging near the anode/separator interface which in turn leads to a sharp resistance rise.},

The overall goal is to demonstrate the impact of the volume expansion on battery ageing. The following findings are achieved: First, the characteristic curve shape of the diameter change depended on the state-of-charge and the load direction of the battery. The characteristic curve shape consisted of three areas. Second, the characteristic curve shape of the diameter change changed over ageing. Whereas the state-of-charge dependent geometric alterations were of a reversible nature. An irreversible effect over the lifetime of the cell was observed. Third, an s-shaped course of the diameter change indicated two different ageing effects that led to the diameter change variation. Both reversible and irreversible expansion increased with ageing. Fourth, a direct correlation between the diameter change and the capacity loss of this particular lithium-ion battery was observed. Fifth, computer tomography (CT) measurements showed deformation of the jelly roll and post-mortem analysis showed the formation of a covering layer and the increase in the thickness of the anode. Sixth, reproducibility and temperature stability of the strain gauges were shown. Overall, this paper provides the basis for a stable and reproducible method for volume expansion analysis applied and established by the investigation of a state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery cell.

There is a dearth of experimental methods to probe these concentration gradients across the depth of the electrode. Here we use spatially resolved energy dispersive X-ray diffraction to obtain a “movie” of lithiation and delithiation in different sections of the cell and quantify lithium gradients that develop in a porous graphite electrode during cycling at a 1C rate.
