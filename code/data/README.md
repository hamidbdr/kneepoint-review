# Description of data files
The following three files were added for the investigation of linear relationship between knee point and EOL across datasets and accross knee identification methods.<br>
- knee_point_EOL_linreg_data.csv<br>
  CSV file containing, for each source of data, the name of the source, as well as the cycle number at which knee point and EOL were identified, using the BW method.
- knee_point_eol_plot_dict.pkl<br>
  Pickle file containing a dictionary with, for each source of data, a colour, legend entry (label) and marker type to be used for plotting.
- severson2019_EOL-2-knee-All-algorithms.csv<br>
  File containing identified end-of-life and EOL knees from the several algorithms accross the Severson et al 2019 dataset. (BW_point=Bacon Watts knee-points from Fermin et al 2020, BW_onset= Bacon Watts knee-onset from Fermin et al 2020, diao_point=knee-points from algorithm from Diao et al 2019, kneedle_point=knee-point from algorithm, bisector_point= Greenbank & Howey 2021 knee-point)
